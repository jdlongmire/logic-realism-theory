**Subject:** Logical Realism Applied to Quantum Foundations - Invitation to Engage

---

Dear Professor Tahko,

I'm writing to introduce a research program that directly engages with the framework you articulated in your 2021 *Synthese* paper, "A Survey of Logical Realism." Your distinction between realism about logical constants and realism about logical structure, and particularly your discussion of the overgeneration problem, maps precisely onto questions I've been working through from the physics side.

**Logic Realism Theory (LRT)** proposes that the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) are not merely cognitive conventions but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. The core result: complex quantum mechanics is the unique probabilistic theory satisfying these constraints.

The derivation chain runs:

3FLL → Distinguishability metric → Inner product → Masanes-Müller axioms → Complex QM

This addresses your overgeneration problem directly: the 3FLL aren't arbitrary structure—they're what makes distinguishability (and hence information) possible at all. The physics payoff demonstrates this isn't generic metaphysics.

**Published work:**
- Main paper: "It from Bit, Bit from Fit: Foundational Physics Logically Remastered"
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17831819
- Technical foundations, philosophical foundations, and QFT extension papers also on Zenodo

**Ongoing development:**
- GitHub repository with derivations, supplementary papers, and open issues
  https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory

I'm particularly interested in your perspective on several points:

1. **The E/D distinction**: LRT treats the 3FLL as D-fundamental (part of the structure being described), expressed via E-fundamental logical vocabulary. Does this framing hold up philosophically?

2. **Primitive incompatibility**: Your suggestion that negation be grounded in primitive incompatibility aligns with LRT's treatment of Non-Contradiction. The IIS-LRT framework locates this: contradictions are representable (Stage 1) but not actualizable (Stage 3).

3. **Falsifiability**: Unlike purely philosophical logical realism, LRT makes testable predictions (e.g., constraints on decoherence scaling). Does connecting logical realism to physics change its epistemic status?

I would welcome any engagement—whether critique, questions, or potential collaboration. The project is explicitly positioned at the metaphysics-of-science intersection you work in, and I believe dialogue with philosophers working on logical realism would strengthen both the framework and its articulation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

**Brief background:** I'm an independent researcher with a background in systems engineering and formal methods (20+ years at Northrop Grumman). This work grew from applying information-theoretic and logical foundations to questions in quantum mechanics—arriving at the metaphysics-of-logic literature from the physics side rather than the philosophy side. I'm seeking engagement with the philosophical community to ensure the framework is rigorous and well-positioned.
