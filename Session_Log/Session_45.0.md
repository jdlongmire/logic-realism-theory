## Previous Session Summary (44.0)

Session 44.0 accomplished two major tasks:

1. **Core Paper Consolidation**
   - Transformed `logic_realism_theory_foundation.md` into definitive core paper
   - Merged content from Main-v2 and Technical-v3
   - Strengthened logical gaps (chaos argument, least action, S_spec)
   - Added IIS, Boolean Actuality, reconstruction theorem, variational framework
   - Archived superseded papers to `theory/archive/2025-12-16/`

2. **Gap Closure Roadmap**
   - Created Issues 012-018 defining path to mature theory
   - Phase 1: Mathematical Rigor (012-014)
   - Phase 2: Physical Extension (015-016)
   - Phase 3: Computational Verification (017)
   - Phase 4: Empirical Confrontation (018)

## Session Objective

**Issue 012: Derive the First Constants (Fine Structure Constant)**

**The Gap:** LRT claims α ≈ 1/137 emerges from parsimony optimization but has not calculated the value from first principles.

**Success Metric:** Derive α that matches empirical value from:
```
min(S_total) where S_total = S_spec(k) + λ(C(k) - C_min)
```

## Issue 012 Summary

From `theory/issues/Issue_012_Derive_First_Constants.md`:

### What LRT Claims
- Constants emerge from Global Parsimony minimization
- S_total = S_spec(k) + C(k) subject to C ≥ C_min
- Fine structure constant is "optimal" rather than arbitrary

### What's Missing
| Component | Definition Status | Calculation Status |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| S_spec(k) | Conceptual (log₂\|k - k₀\|/δk) | No numerical evaluation |
| C(k) | Structural complexity | No explicit form |
| C_min | Minimum viable complexity | Not determined |
| Optimization | Lagrangian sketched | Not solved |

### Required Steps
1. Define S_spec explicitly (information-theoretic)
2. Define C(k) for electromagnetic coupling
3. Determine C_min threshold
4. Solve the optimization problem
