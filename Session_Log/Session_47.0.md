## Previous Session Summary (46.0)

Session 46.0 was a major philosophy and submission-focused session:

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Philosophy Paper Major Revision** - Responded to formal referee report with complete restructure
2. **Core Thesis Formalized** - 𝔄 = 𝔏(𝔍) decomposed into Theorem 1 (𝔄 ⊆ 𝔏(𝔍), proved) + Conjecture 1 (𝔏(𝔍) ⊆ 𝔄, open)
3. **Co-constitutive Framing** - Clarified that 𝔏 and 𝔍 jointly constitute physical reality 𝔄
4. **IJQF Submission Package** - Complete and referee-hardened for submission to International Journal of Quantum Foundations
5. **Red Team Defenses** - Added defenses for parsimony, intuitionist, and QBist critiques
6. **LRT Formal Core** - Created tightest possible framing document (`theory/LRT_Formal_Core.md`)
