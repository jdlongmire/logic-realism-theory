**Session Number**: 1.2
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Focus**: Prepare Sprint 1 and establish CI/CD infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ **SPRINT 1 READY** (Infrastructure complete)

---

## Session Overview

**Purpose**: Set up Sprint 1 planning infrastructure and implement standard CI/CD practices to maintain code quality.

**User Directive**: "prepare sprint 1" + "make sure we follow standard CI/CD processes"

**Result**: Complete sprint infrastructure + automated testing/validation pipelines

---

## Phase 1: Sprint Infrastructure ✅

### Sprint Folder Structure Created

**Created**:
- `sprints/` - Sprint root folder
- `sprints/README.md` - Sprint overview and status tracking
- `sprints/sprint_1/` - Sprint 1 folder
- `sprints/sprint_1/SPRINT_1_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive sprint plan
- `sprints/sprint_1/SPRINT_1_TRACKING.md` - Daily progress tracking

**Sprint 1 Goals**:
1. **Primary**: CI/CD infrastructure, Lean operators, Notebook 01
2. **Secondary**: Actualization definition (optional)

**Aligned to**: Foundational paper Sections 3.3 (operators) and 2 (3FLL necessity)

---

## Phase 2: CI/CD Infrastructure ✅

### GitHub Actions Workflows Created

Following standard CI/CD practices for Lean + Jupyter repositories:

#### 1. Lean Build Automation (`.github/workflows/lean-build.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push/PR to master with Lean file changes

**Actions**:
- Install Elan (Lean version manager)
- Cache Mathlib (faster builds)
- Run `lake build`
- **Check for sorry statements** (fails if any found)
- **Count axioms** (warns if > 2)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ Build must succeed
- ✅ Sorry count must be 0
- ✅ Axiom count should be ≤ 2

#### 2. Notebook Testing (`.github/workflows/notebook-test.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push/PR to master with notebook changes

**Actions**:
- Set up Python environment
- Install requirements
- **Execute all notebooks** (validates code works)
- **Check copyright headers** (ensures proper attribution)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ All notebooks must execute without errors
- ✅ Copyright headers must be present

#### 3. Documentation Checks (`.github/workflows/documentation-check.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push/PR to master with markdown changes

**Actions**:
- **Verify required files exist** (README, CLAUDE.md, foundational paper, etc.)
- **Check for broken internal links**
- **Validate Session Log sequence**

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ All required documentation must exist
- ⚠️  Broken links produce warnings (don't fail CI)

---

## Phase 3: Sprint 1 Plan ✅

### Detailed Sprint Plan Created

**File**: `sprints/sprint_1/SPRINT_1_PLAN.md`

**Content**:
- **Overview**: Purpose and north star reference
- **Current State**: What's complete vs. what needs work
- **Sprint Goals**: Primary and secondary deliverables
- **Detailed Task Breakdown**: Track 0 (CI/CD), Track 1 (Operators), Track 2 (Notebook), Track 3 (Actualization)
- **Success Criteria**: Must have, should have, nice to have
- **Team Consultation Budget**: 3-5 consultations allocated
- **Timeline**: 2-3 week estimate
- **Risks and Mitigation**: Identified potential blockers
- **Deliverable Checklist**: Comprehensive checklist for completion

**Key Features**:

- Emphasis on canonical locations (NOT in sprint folders)

---

## Phase 4: Sprint Tracking Document ✅

### Daily Tracking Template Created

**File**: `sprints/sprint_1/SPRINT_1_TRACKING.md`

**Structure**:
- **Progress Tracker**: Tables for each track (CI/CD, Operators, Notebook, Actualization)
- **Daily Log**: Append-only log of daily activities
- **Team Consultations**: Track usage of consultation budget
- **Files Created/Modified**: Running list of deliverables
- **Blockers and Issues**: Capture problems as they arise

**Update Protocol**:

---

## CI/CD Technical Details

### Workflow Triggers

**lean-build.yml**:
- Runs on: push/PR to master
- Path filter: `lean/**`, workflow file
- When: Any Lean code changes

**notebook-test.yml**:
- Runs on: push/PR to master
- Path filter: `notebooks/**`, workflow file
- When: Any notebook changes

**documentation-check.yml**:
- Runs on: push/PR to master
- Path filter: `**.md`, `docs/**`, workflow file
- When: Any documentation changes

### Caching Strategy

**Lean builds**:
- Cache `~/.elan` (Lean installations)
- Cache `lean/.lake` (Mathlib downloads)
- Key: OS + toolchain version + manifest hash
- Restore keys: Fallback to partial matches
- **Benefit**: Much faster builds (Mathlib doesn't re-download)

### Quality Checks

**Sorry statements**:
```bash
grep -r "sorry" lean/LogicRealismTheory --include="*.lean" \
  | grep -v "^.*--.*sorry" \    # Exclude comments
  | grep -v "^.*/-.*sorry" \    # Exclude block comments
  | wc -l
```
- Exits with error if count > 0
- Prints line numbers of violations

**Axiom counting**:
```bash
grep -r "^axiom " lean/LogicRealismTheory --include="*.lean" | wc -l
```
- Warns if count > 2
- Prints axiom locations

**Notebook execution**:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebook.ipynb
```
- Executes all cells in order
- Fails if any cell raises exception

8. Verify builds, CI passes

### Option B - Notebook 01 (Track 2)
1. Create `notebooks/01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb`
2. Add 3-line copyright header
3. Write Section 1: 2-Axiom Foundation
4. Write Section 2: 3FLL Necessity
5. Write Section 3: 3FLL as Theorems
6. Write Section 4: L as Unified Constraint
7. Test all cells, verify CI passes

**User to decide**: Which track to prioritize?

## Lessons Learned

### 1. CI/CD as First-Class Concern

User's directive "make sure we follow standard CI/CD processes" was critical. Quality automation prevents:
- Accidental sorry statements
- Axiom count drift
- Broken notebooks
- Documentation decay

**Lesson**: Set up CI/CD early, enforce quality from the start

### 2. Sprint Planning at Start

Creating comprehensive sprint plan before coding prevents:
- Scope creep
- Missing deliverables
- Unclear success criteria
- Fragmented work

**Lesson**: Plan sprints thoroughly before execution

### 3. Automated Enforcement Better Than Manual

Automated checking (sorry, axioms, notebooks) is more reliable than manual review:
- Runs on every push
- Can't be forgotten
- Provides immediate feedback
- Prevents regressions

**Lesson**: Automate quality checks wherever possible

### 4. Tracking Templates Provide Structure

Having SPRINT_1_TRACKING.md template ready encourages:
- Daily updates
- Systematic progress tracking
- Clear status communication
- Historical record

**Lesson**: Create tracking infrastructure before work begins

## Key Insights

### 1. Infrastructure Before Code

Setting up CI/CD and sprint planning before writing code ensures:
- Quality is enforced automatically
- Work is well-scoped
- Progress is trackable
- Success criteria are clear

This is standard software engineering practice, now applied to LRT.

### 2. Automated Quality Maintenance

**2-axiom minimalism** is now enforced by CI:
- Axiom count checked on every push
- Warning issued if count exceeds 2
- Prevents accidental axiom additions

**0-sorry completeness** is now enforced by CI:
- Sorry count checked on every push
- Build fails if any sorry found
- Prevents incomplete proofs from merging

### 3. Sprint Structure Prevents Fragmentation

Following CLAUDE.md sprint protocol:
- Sprint folders contain ONLY tracking docs
- Deliverables go to canonical locations
- No subfolders (no team_consultations/, notebooks/, lean/ in sprint folders)

This maintains single sources of truth.

### 4. Ready for Professional Development

With CI/CD, sprint planning, and quality automation:
- Work proceeds systematically
- Quality is maintained automatically
- Progress is tracked transparently
- Regressions are caught immediately

LRT repository now follows professional software development standards.
