## Current State of the Theory

### Core Framework
- **LRT**: Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) as ontological constraints
- **IIS-LRT**: Three-stage framework (Representable → Permissible → Actual)
- **Technical**: A+ grade MM→Complex QM reconstruction

### Axiom Count
- **Tier 1 (LRT Specific)**: 2 axioms (I, I_infinite)
- **Tier 2 (Established Math Tools)**: ~16 axioms
- **Tier 3 (Universal Physics)**: 1 axiom
- **Total**: ~19 axioms

### Lean Formalization
- 55 `sorry` statements remaining (proof obligations)
- Infrastructure and structure documented
- Formal proofs deferred until after empirical validation

### Open Work
1. **Priority 1**: β ≤ 2 prediction in macroscopic regime (best empirical test)
2. **Priority 2**: Born rule from IIS-LRT principles (central open problem)
3. **Priority 3**: External engagement (peer review, conferences)
