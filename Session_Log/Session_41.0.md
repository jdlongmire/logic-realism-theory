## Previous Session Summary (40.0)

Session 40.0 (2025-12-13) completed:
- Merged 3 orphaned remote branches (10 commits)
- Resolved merge conflict in Scale Law paper
- Updated README with comprehensive artifact documentation
- Captured IIS-LRT paper development (Issue 010, ~900 lines)
- Created `theory/LRT_Internal_Assessment.md` - honest state of the theory
- Ran sanity check protocol on theory root (all passed)

---

## Git Status at Session Start

**Branch:** master (up to date with origin/master)

**Uncommitted changes:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (modified)
- `articles-commentary/` folder renamed to `blog-articles-commentary/` (shows as deleted + untracked)

## Current State of the Theory

### Core Framework
- **LRT**: Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) as ontological constraints
- **IIS-LRT**: Three-stage framework (Representable → Permissible → Actual)
- **Technical**: A+ grade MM→Complex QM reconstruction

### Axiom Count
- **Tier 1 (LRT Specific)**: 2 axioms (I, I_infinite)
- **Tier 2 (Established Math Tools)**: ~16 axioms
- **Tier 3 (Universal Physics)**: 1 axiom
- **Total**: ~19 axioms

### Lean Formalization
- 55 `sorry` statements remaining (proof obligations)
- Infrastructure and structure documented
- Formal proofs deferred until after empirical validation

### Open Work
1. **Priority 1**: β ≤ 2 prediction in macroscopic regime (best empirical test)
2. **Priority 2**: Born rule from IIS-LRT principles (central open problem)
3. **Priority 3**: External engagement (peer review, conferences)

## Work This Session

### 1. Substack Introductory Post

Created `blog-articles-commentary/Substack_Intro_Post.md` for promoting LRT on Substack.

**Content:**
- Core thesis: 3FLL as ontological constraints
- Three-stage IIS-LRT framework with MWI comparison
- Honest status assessment (what's established vs open)
- Published papers with Zenodo DOIs
- Links to theory artifacts on GitHub
- Future content roadmap (theory development, research commentary, methodology)

**References the full theory folder:** https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory/tree/master/theory

### 2. Commentary: Faizal et al. MToE Paper

Created `blog-articles-commentary/Commentary_Faizal_MToE_Undecidability.md`

**Paper reviewed:** Faizal, Krauss, Shabir & Marino (2025). "Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything." arXiv:2507.22950

**Commentary highlights:**
- Core argument: Gödel/Tarski/Chaitin limits constrain algorithmic TOE
- MToE introduces non-recursive truth predicate to overcome limits
- Independent convergence with LRT (A = L(I))
- Formal correspondence: T(x) ≡ L|Σ_QG
- Both conclude: reality is meta-logical, not computational

**References:**
- arXiv:2507.22950 (the reviewed paper)
- Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17533459 (LRT-MToE formal equivalence)
