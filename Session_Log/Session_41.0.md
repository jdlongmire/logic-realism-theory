## Work This Session

### 1. Substack Infrastructure

Created `blog-articles-commentary/` folder structure:
- Renamed from `articles-commentary/`
- Added `figures/` subfolder for header images
- Established naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_Title.md`
- Updated README with formatting guidelines

### 2. Substack Introductory Post

**File**: `2025-12-14_Substack_Intro_Post.md`

Content:
- Core thesis: 3FLL as ontological constraints
- Three-stage IIS-LRT framework with MWI comparison
- Honest status assessment (what's established vs open)
- Published papers with Zenodo DOIs
- Links to theory artifacts on GitHub
- Future content roadmap

### 3. Commentary: Faizal et al. MToE Paper

**File**: `2025-12-14_Commentary_Faizal_MToE_Undecidability.md`

**Paper reviewed**: Faizal, Krauss, Shabir & Marino (2025). "Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything." arXiv:2507.22950

Key points:
- Gödel/Tarski/Chaitin limits constrain algorithmic TOE
- MToE introduces non-recursive truth predicate
- Independent convergence with LRT: T(x) ≡ L|Σ_QG
- Both conclude: reality is meta-logical, not computational

**References**: arXiv:2507.22950, Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17533459

### 4. Commentary: Tahko Logical Realism Survey

**File**: `2025-12-13_Commentary_Tahko_Logical_Realism_Survey.md`

**Paper reviewed**: Tahko (2021). "A Survey of Logical Realism." Synthese 198, 4775-4790.

Key points:
- Logical realism = logical facts exist + mind-independent
- Two versions: realism about constants vs structure
- LRT aligns with realism about logical structure
- Addresses overgeneration problem via derivational specificity
- Three-stage framework locates where contradictions excluded

### 5. Commentary: McSweeney Cost of Closure

**File**: `2025-12-14_Commentary_McSweeney_Cost_of_Closure.md`

**Paper reviewed**: McSweeney (2021). "The Cost of Closure." Synthese 199, 12795-12817.

Key points:
- Logical realism + anti-exceptionalism undermine equivalence assumptions
- Can't assume logically equivalent theories are theoretically equivalent
- LRT accepts the cost
- 3FLL not revisable - constitutive of distinguishability
- Derivation (3FLL → QM) provides criterion for "true" logic

### 6. Header Images

Added figures for each commentary:
- `figures/LRT-MToE.png` → Faizal/MToE commentary
- `figures/Tahko-article.png` → Tahko commentary
- `figures/McSweeney-article.png` → McSweeney commentary

### 7. README Updates

- Root README: Added "Articles and Commentaries" section
- Root README: Updated Development History (41 sessions)
- Folder README: Updated with all 4 articles and naming convention
