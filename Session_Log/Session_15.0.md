# Session 15.0

**Date**: 2025-11-25
**Focus**: TBD - Awaiting user direction
**Status**: Initialized - Ready for instructions

## Context from Session 14.0

**Previous Session Achievements**:
1. Lean folder documentation cleanup (8 files reviewed, 3 archived)
2. Theory folder organization
3. Derivations remediation sprint (all 7 files pass sanity check)
4. Paper formalization section created (1000+ lines)
5. Computational validation sprint planned (5 Python scripts)
6. LRT Explanatory Power streamlined (1,249 → 378 lines)
7. Paper refactor plan created (LRT_Paper_Refactor.md)

**Pending Tasks from Session 14.0**:
- Execute computational validation sprint (5 Python scripts)
- Execute paper refactor using LRT_Paper_Refactor.md
- Continue Lean formalization (55 sorries remain)
- Other user-directed tasks

## Work Log

### Initialization

**Session Started**: 2025-11-25
**Operating Mode**: PhD-level theoretical physicist/mathematician (AI-Collaboration-Profile.json)
**Core Mandate**: Root out circularity, avoid workarounds, maintain highest standards

## Work Completed

### 1. Repository Sync
- Fetched remote, confirmed local up to date
- Committed and pushed theory paper restructuring from between-session work

### 2. Evaluated Theory Document Restructuring
- Compared 3 new documents vs. deprecated foundational paper
- Identified strengths: clean separation, appropriate audiences, better honest assessment
- Identified gaps: lost empirical predictions, Lean status, Session 13.0 derivations connection

### 3. Created Fourth Paper: LRT_Predictions_Validation.md (~2,800 words)
New modular paper covering:
- Variational framework (K_total = (ln 2)/β + 1/β² + 4β²)
- Primary prediction: T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9
- Secondary predictions: Hamiltonian shifts, QEC entropy coupling
- Experimental protocols with confound isolation
- Lean formalization status (~19 axioms, 3-tier system)
- Computational validation (QuTiP results)

### 4. Updated Cross-References
- Logic_Realism_Theory.md: Added companion papers note
- LRT_Metaphysical_Architecture.md: Updated "subsequent paper" → specific paper names
- LRT_Formal_Mathematics.md: Updated introduction to reference all companion papers

### 5. Final Document Structure
