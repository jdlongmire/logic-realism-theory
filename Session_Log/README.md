## Recent Sessions

### Session 23.0 (2025-11-27) - Empirical Challenge Reframing

**Major structural revision** to prevent philosophical deflection:

- **Section 1.1 "The Challenge"** (new): Opens with empirical fact, issues explicit challenge
- **Section 32.6 "The Challenge Renewed"**: Closes with challenge restated
- Renumbered Section 1 subsections (1.1-1.4 → 1.2-1.5)

**Effect**: Paper now anchors in physical evidence before philosophical apparatus. Reviewers must engage with the brute fact that no physical measurement has ever violated 3FLL.

### Session 22.0 (2025-11-27) - Structural Framing & Archive Integration

**Reviewer recommendations implemented:**
- Section 1.4 "Structure of the Argument" (two-part architecture)
- Section 7.7 "What Part I Establishes" (Part I closure)
- Section 32.2b "The Two-Part Structure" (conclusion recapitulation)
- 4 signposting paragraphs (end of Parts I-IV)
- Abstract revision for two-part clarity

**Archive nuggets integrated:**
- Section 4.7: L = P ∘ C decomposition
- Section 22.1: S = ℏC development expanded
- Section 22.5: Time from NC interpretation

**ISSUE 005 created**: Variational framework (T2/T1 prediction) tracked for future work

### Session 21.0 (2025-11-27) - Paper Completion

- Section 32 (Conclusion) completed
- ISSUE 004 Editorial Remediation closed
- Polished abstract integrated
- Repository reorganized

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete Master Paper**: 32 sections integrating philosophical foundations, physical interpretation, mathematical structure, and empirical signatures

2. **Empirical Anchor**: Paper now leads and concludes with the unanswerable challenge - produce one physical measurement violating 3FLL

3. **Two-Part Structure**: Explicit separation of metaphysical thesis (Part I) from physics overlay (Parts II-IV)

4. **Honest Assessment**: 17 retrodictions, 12 falsifiers, 1 confirmed prediction, acknowledged limitations

5. **Archive Integration**: Key nuggets (P ∘ C, S = ℏC, Time from NC) integrated without overclaiming
