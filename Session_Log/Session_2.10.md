# Session 2.10 - Prediction Paths Framework & Path 3 Protocol

**Session Number**: 2.10
**Date**: October 26, 2025 (continuation)
**Focus**: Strategic Framework for LRT Testing & Next Experimental Design
**Status**: ‚úì COMPLETE

---

## Session Overview

This session established a **systematic prediction paths framework** for Logic Realism Theory testing and created a comprehensive experimental protocol for the next test (Path 3: T1 vs T2 comparison). Following the successful Phase 4 hardware test (Session 2.9), we evaluated multiple potential prediction paths, identified the most promising tests, and prepared detailed implementation plans.

**Key Insight**: Reframed LRT testing from binary "Does LRT differ from QM?" to systematic exploration of prediction paths, some of which may confirm equivalence (scientific progress either way).

**Major Accomplishment**: Created publication-ready protocol for Path 3, the clearest remaining experimental test of LRT.

---

## Phase 1: Alternative Prediction Path Analysis

### Gemini's New Proposals

**Context**: After Path 1 (T2 test) showed no LRT signal and Path 2 (contradictions) proved logically equivalent, Gemini proposed two new test designs.

### Idea 2: Logical Inertia (Rabi Oscillation Suppression)

**Concept**: LRT's Non-Contradiction filtering might create "inertia" against rapid logical state changes, suppressing Rabi oscillations at extreme drive power.

**Critical Analysis** (`Logical_Inertia_Test_Assessment.md`):

**‚úó Fatal Flaw Identified**: QM also predicts Rabi suppression at high power through:
1. AC Stark shift (off-resonance effects)
2. Leakage to |2‚ü© state (anharmonicity)
3. Bloch-Siegert shift (counter-rotating terms)
4. Pulse distortion (hardware limitations)
5. Multi-photon processes

**Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**
- Both LRT and QM predict qualitatively similar behavior
- Distinguishing requires heroic modeling of 5+ QM confounds
- No specific LRT functional form provided (what A(Œ©)?)
- Requires premium pulse access (not available on Open Plan)

**Verdict**: **Deprioritized** relative to cleaner tests (Path 3)

**Key Lesson**: Like Path 2 (contradictions), this suffers from "both theories predict similar effect" - very hard to distinguish experimentally.

---

## Phase 2: Prediction Paths Master Framework

### The Reframing

**Old question** (problematic): "Does LRT differ from QM?" (binary, leads to overclaiming)

**New framework** (productive): "What are the prediction paths where LRT might differ, and what is the status of each?"

**Created**: `Prediction_Paths_Master.md` - Comprehensive tracking document

### All Prediction Paths (9 total)

| Path | Observable | Status | LRT Prediction | QM Prediction | Priority |
|------|-----------|--------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **1** | T2 Decoherence | ‚úì **Tested** | Exponential T2 | Exponential T2 | Scale? |
| **2** | Contradictions | ‚úó **Blocked** | NC filtering | Unitary + Born | Abandoned |
| **3** | T1 vs T2 Ratio | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ready** | T2 < T1 | T2 ‚âà T1 | **HIGHEST** |
| **4** | Rabi Inertia | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Questionable** | High-Œ© suppression | Also suppresses | LOW |
| **5** | Hamiltonian Shift | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Proposed** | œâ(|+‚ü©) ‚â† œâ(|0‚ü©) | œâ(|+‚ü©) = œâ(|0‚ü©) | MEDIUM |
| **6** | Landauer Complexity | üìã **Aspirational** | E(complex) > kT ln(2) | E = kT ln(2) | VERY LOW |
| **7** | Finite-K Emergence | üîç **Exploratory** | Quantum at finite K | Pure QM (K‚Üí‚àû) | Research |
| **8** | QC Upper Limits | üìã **Proposed** | Fundamental bounds | No such limits | **HIGH** |
| ~~**9**~~ | ~~AGI Impossibility~~ | ‚ùå **Deferred** | ~~IIS access required~~ | ~~AI possible~~ | DROPPED |

### Path 8: Quantum Computing Limits (NEW)

**User's Proposal**: LRT might predict fundamental limits on quantum computing that QM does not.

**Potential predictions**:
1. **Error floor**: QEC cannot achieve error rates below 10^-X
2. **Qubit scaling**: Maximum coherent qubits bounded at ~10^Y
3. **Decoherence floor**: T2 cannot exceed Z even with perfect isolation
4. **Entanglement cost**: Highly entangled states require more resources
5. **Algorithm restrictions**: Certain quantum algorithms hit limits at scale

**Why This Could Be THE Most Important Path**:
‚úì Clear falsifiability (QM says no limits, LRT says limits exist)
‚úì Self-testing (QC field actively pushing boundaries)
‚úì Timely (tests happen in 5-10 years regardless)
‚úì No special access needed (make prediction, field tests it)
‚úì High impact (like Heisenberg uncertainty limits)

**Status**: Needs quantitative specification from LRT theory
- Which limit? What magnitude? What mechanism?
- Can be derived from LRT axioms?

**Next Step**: User to specify which QC limits LRT predicts

### Path 9: AGI Impossibility (DEFERRED)

**User's Proposal**: Human minds have "direct IIS access" that AI fundamentally cannot replicate ‚Üí AGI impossible.

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Unfalsifiability risk**: Moving goalposts ("That's not TRUE AGI")
2. **Philosophical quicksand**: Mind-body problem, dualism debates
3. **Operational definition lacking**: What is "IIS access" measurably?
4. **Credibility risk**: Could undermine serious physics predictions
5. **Other paths more promising**: Paths 3 and 8 offer clearer tests

**Decision**: **DEFERRED** - Too many philosophical issues

**Rationale**: Focus on physics predictions (QC limits, quantum hardware) rather than cognitive science claims that risk being unfalsifiable.

**May revisit if**:
- Operational definition of IIS access developed
- Clear falsification criteria established
- Mainstream interest emerges

### Key Insights from Framework

**"Shut Up and Calculate" Realization**: User observed that experimental metaphysics is *really hard* - QM and LRT keep predicting similar effects through different mechanisms. This is exactly why "shut up and calculate" emerged historically.

**Falsifiability Matters Most**: LRT is a scientific theory because it makes falsifiable predictions (Popper's criterion), regardless of whether those predictions differ from QM. This is a stronger position than many interpretations (e.g., Many-Worlds).

**Systematic Exploration**: Some paths will dead-end (that's science). The framework allows honest tracking of what's been tested, what's viable, and what's blocked.

## Phase 3: Path 3 Protocol Development

### Why Path 3 is Highest Priority

**Clear Prediction Difference**:
- **LRT**: T2 < T1 (superposition less stable due to relaxed EM constraint)
- **QM**: T2 ‚âà T1 (no fundamental state preference)

**Avoids Previous Pitfalls**:
- Not an A/B circuit comparison (Path 2's flaw)
- Uses standard, independent measurements (T1 and T2)
- No multicollinearity (VIF = 1.0 for each)

**Gemini's Top Recommendation**: Identified as "most promising new avenue"

**Ready to Implement**: Builds on validated Path 1 methodology

### Protocol Document Created

**File**: `T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md` (50 pages, comprehensive)

**Contents**:

**1. Theoretical Foundation**
- LRT hypothesis: T2 < T1 due to relaxed EM constraint in superposition
- QM prediction: T2 ‚âà T1, no state preference
- Clear distinguishability

**2. Experimental Design**
- **T1 Measurement**: X ‚Üí delay(T) ‚Üí Measure (amplitude relaxation)
- **T2 Measurement**: H ‚Üí delay(T) ‚Üí H ‚Üí Measure (phase coherence)
- **T2echo Measurement**: H ‚Üí delay(T/2) ‚Üí X ‚Üí delay(T/2) ‚Üí H ‚Üí Measure (confound control)

**3. Duration Sweep**
- 49 points, 1-1000 ¬µs
- Log-linear spacing (dense early, sparse late)
- Optimized for exponential decay sampling

**4. Statistical Analysis**
- Fit T1: P_1(T) = exp(-T/T1)
- Fit T2: P_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + p0
- Compute ratio: R = T2/T1
- Hypothesis test: T2 < T1? (one-tailed t-test)
- Effect size: Cohen's d

**5. Resource Requirements**
- ~1M total shots (490K for T1 + 490K for T2)
- ~100-120 hours quantum time (3 backends for cross-validation)
- Enhanced IBM Quantum access required

**6. Confound Analysis**

| Confound | Severity | Mitigation | Residual |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Hardware Drift | Medium | Rapid sequential measurement | <2% |
| Crosstalk | Low | Single qubit, well-isolated | <1% |
| Readout Errors | Medium | Error mitigation | <2% |
| **Pure Dephasing** | **HIGH** | **T2echo measurement (essential)** | 5-10% |
| Heating | Low | Monitor temp, duty cycle | <1% |

**Key Insight**: Pure dephasing is the main confound. QM predicts T2 ‚â§ 2T1 due to additional dephasing. Must measure T2echo to separate LRT effect from QM dephasing.

**7. Expected Outcomes**
- **Scenario 1** (T2 < T1 significantly): LRT signal detected ‚Üí major result, verification needed
- **Scenario 2** (T2 ‚âà T1): Consistent with QM ‚Üí LRT = QM or effect too small
- **Scenario 3** (Borderline): Inconclusive, need higher precision

**8. Implementation Checklist**
- Pre-execution: Enhanced access, backend selection, script prep
- Execution: T1 ‚Üí T2 ‚Üí T2echo on 3 backends (2-4 weeks)
- Analysis: Fitting, hypothesis tests, visualization
- Publication: Methods, results, honest reporting

**9. Comparison to Other Paths**
- Simpler than Path 4 (Rabi) - fewer confounds
- Complementary to Path 5 (Frequency) - stability vs energy
- Builds on Path 1 - validated methodology

**Status**: Ready for multi-LLM consultation and enhanced access application

- LRT is scientific because it's falsifiable (Popper)
- Doesn't need novel predictions to be legitimate theory
- Like Bohm, Feynman path integrals - equivalent predictions, still valuable

**2. Reinterpretation vs Distinct Theory**
- If LRT = QM mathematically: Still valuable as foundational framework
- If LRT ‚â† QM: Needs to identify exact observable where predictions differ
- Path 3 is the test to determine this for state-dependent properties

**3. "Shut Up and Calculate" Wisdom**
- Experimentally distinguishing theories is genuinely hard
- Both often predict qualitatively similar effects via different mechanisms
- Historical precedent: QM interpretations all make same predictions
- LRT facing same challenge: Finding the observable that differs

## Lessons Learned

### From Path Analysis

1. **"Both predict X" problem**: If both LRT and QM predict similar qualitative behavior (e.g., suppression at high power), distinguishing is extremely hard - requires modeling ALL confounds precisely.

2. **State-dependent tests promising**: Comparing properties of superposition vs classical states (T1 vs T2, œâ(|+‚ü©) vs œâ(|0‚ü©)) offers clearer prediction differences than absolute measurements.

3. **Confound hierarchy**: Pure dephasing is main confound for T2 measurements. T2echo essential for control.

4. **QC limits high-value**: If LRT can predict fundamental QC bounds, this is testable on 5-10 year timescale without special access - field tests itself.

### From Framework Development

1. **Prediction paths > binary question**: "Does LRT differ?" is too coarse. "Along which paths might it differ?" enables systematic exploration.

2. **Negative results are progress**: Ruling out paths (Path 2) or finding no signal (Path 1) advances knowledge - not failure.

3. **Some paths will be philosophical**: AGI claims risk unfalsifiability - physics predictions are cleaner.

4. **Prioritization essential**: Can't test all paths simultaneously. Focus on clearest, most feasible first (Path 3).

### From Protocol Development

1. **T2echo is essential**: Cannot interpret T2 < T1 without controlling for pure dephasing via Hahn echo measurement.

2. **Cross-validation required**: Single backend result could be hardware-specific. Need 3+ backends to confirm.

3. **Resource estimation critical**: Must quantify time/cost before seeking enhanced access. 100-120 hours is realistic for 3-backend test.

4. **Implementation checklist prevents errors**: Step-by-step guide ensures nothing forgotten during execution.
