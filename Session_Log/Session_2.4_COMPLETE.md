**Key Deliverable**: Session 2.4 log with honest assessment

---

### Phase 5: Root Cause Investigation - Duration Mismatch (Week 1 Day 1-2)
**Duration**: QEC implementation + smoking gun identification
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Implementation**: `qec_implementation.py` (524 lines)

**Components Created**:
1. **LogicalQubit class**: 3-qubit repetition code
   - encode_circuit(): |0⟩_L = |000⟩, |1⟩_L = |111⟩
   - measure_syndrome_circuit(): Detect bit-flip errors
   - decode_circuit(): Reverse encoding
   - full_qec_cycle(): Complete QEC cycle

2. **EntropySequences class**: Low vs high entropy
   - low_entropy_sequence(): Unitary operations only
   - high_entropy_sequence(): Includes measurement/reset
   - calculate_circuit_duration(): Time analysis
   - match_durations(): Framework for equalization

3. **NoiseParameters class**: Realistic IBM noise
   - T1 = 100 μs, T2 = 50 μs
   - Gate times: 1q = 50 ns, 2q = 300 ns
   - Measurement time = 1 μs, reset time = 1 μs

**Critical Finding: Duration Mismatch**
```
Low-entropy duration:  4.350 μs
High-entropy duration: 9.400 μs
Mismatch:              5.050 μs (116% longer)
```

**Impact Analysis**:
```
Decoherence factor = exp(-t/T1) * exp(-t/T2)

Low-entropy (t=4.35 μs):
  T1 decay: exp(-4.35/100) = 0.9575 (4.25% loss)
  T2 decay: exp(-4.35/50) = 0.9168 (8.32% loss)

High-entropy (t=9.40 μs):
  T1 decay: exp(-9.40/100) = 0.9103 (8.97% loss)
  T2 decay: exp(-9.40/50) = 0.8296 (17.04% loss)

Relative decoherence: 2.16x
```

**Mechanism of β Inflation**:
1. High-entropy takes 116% longer
2. Longer duration → 2.16x more decoherence
3. Higher errors correlate with duration, not just ΔS
4. Regression: `log(p_log) = α + β*ΔS`
5. β absorbs duration effect
6. **Result**: β inflated 100x-500x

**Conclusion**: **SMOKING GUN IDENTIFIED** (or so we thought)

### Phase 6: Fix Attempt - Duration Matching (Week 1 Day 3)
**Duration**: Implementation of corrected simulation
**Status**: ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - Additional issues discovered

**Implementation**: `corrected_simulation.py` (470 lines)

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. Duration-matched sequences (add delays to low-entropy)
2. Proper entropy calculation (remove measurements)
3. Full analysis pipeline

**Results**: Discovered 4 NEW problems:

#### Problem 1: Duration Matching Didn't Work
- Delay gates added successfully
- But `calculate_circuit_duration()` doesn't count delays
- Duration mismatch unchanged: still 5.050 μs (53.7%)
- **Root cause**: Delays aren't gate operations

#### Problem 2: Entropy Calculation Broken
- Initial version: ΔS = 0.0000 for ALL samples
- Caused β = -80 trillion (nonsense from zero variance)
- **Root cause**: Measurements interfere with density matrix save

**Fix Applied**:
```python
qc_copy.remove_final_measurements()  # CRITICAL
qc_copy.save_density_matrix()
```

**Result**: Partial success
- High-entropy: Now works (ΔS = 0.158 nats) ✓
- Base low-entropy: Works (ΔS = 0.188 nats) ✓
- Matched low-entropy (with delays): Broken (ΔS = 0.000) ✗

**New problem**: Delay gates break entropy calculation!

#### Problem 3: Qubit Count Mismatch
- Low-entropy circuits: 3 qubits (data only)
- High-entropy circuits: 5 qubits (3 data + 2 syndrome)
- **Issue**: Can't compare entropy of different-sized systems
- Entropy is extensive (scales with system size)

#### Problem 4: High-Entropy Has LOWER ΔS (Backwards!)
When entropy calculation works:
- Low-entropy: ΔS = 0.188 nats
- High-entropy: ΔS = 0.158 nats
- **Expected**: High-entropy should have HIGHER ΔS
- **Actual**: Opposite!

**Implications**:
- Sequence design has conceptual flaw
- "High-entropy" doesn't mean "increases entropy more"
- Measurement/reset may actually REDUCE mixed-state entropy
- Need to rethink what "entropy manipulation" means

## Cumulative Understanding: What We've Learned

### Initial Hypothesis (Phase 5)
> Duration mismatch (5.050 μs) is THE primary cause of β inflation.
> Fix: Add idle time to low-entropy sequences → β drops to 0.1-0.5

**Confidence**: 80-90%

### Revised Understanding (Phase 6)
> Multiple confounds contribute to β inflation:
> 1. Duration mismatch (5.050 μs) ✓ confirmed, not fixed yet
> 2. Entropy calculation issues ✓ partially fixed
> 3. Qubit count mismatch ✓ identified, not fixed
> 4. Sequence design conceptual flaw ✓ identified
> 5. Delay gates incompatible with density matrix ✓ new discovery

**Confidence**: 60-70% (can fix, but more complex than thought)

### Technical Challenges Identified

**Challenge 1: Duration Matching is Hard**
- Can't use delay() gates (breaks entropy calculation)
- Can't just add idle gates (same problem)
- **Solution needed**: Redesign sequences to naturally have same duration using equivalent gate operations

**Challenge 2: Entropy Measurement is Subtle**
- Must remove measurements before density matrix
- Must have consistent qubit count
- Must understand what "entropy manipulation" actually means in QEC context
- **Solution needed**: Careful subsystem entropy analysis

**Challenge 3: Sequence Design is Non-Trivial**
- "High-entropy" sequence doesn't necessarily increase entropy
- Measurement can reduce entropy (projection onto eigenstate)
- Reset definitely reduces entropy (back to |0⟩)
- **Solution needed**: Redesign based on actual entropy behavior, not intuition

**Challenge 4: Multiple Confounds Interact**
- Duration + entropy + qubit count all coupled
- Fixing one doesn't fix all
- **Solution needed**: Systematic approach addressing all simultaneously

## Lessons Learned (Critical for Future Work)

### Lesson 1: Single-Fix Thinking is Dangerous
**Mistake**: Thought duration mismatch was THE problem
**Reality**: Multiple confounds contribute
**Fix**: Always look for interaction effects

### Lesson 2: Test Your Fixes
**Mistake**: Assumed delay gates would work
**Reality**: Delay gates break entropy calculation
**Fix**: Test each component before full integration

### Lesson 3: Understand Your Tools
**Mistake**: Didn't realize density matrix incompatible with measurements
**Reality**: Qiskit has specific requirements for different simulation methods
**Fix**: Read documentation carefully, test edge cases

### Lesson 4: Validate Assumptions
**Mistake**: Assumed "high-entropy sequence" → higher ΔS
**Reality**: Measurement/reset can REDUCE entropy
**Fix**: Measure first, label second

### Lesson 5: Honest Reporting Matters
**Success**: Documented all failures, didn't hide problems
**Result**: Clear understanding of what doesn't work
**Benefit**: Saves time, builds credibility, enables better solutions

## Path Forward: Simplified Approach

### Why Current Approach Failed
1. **Too complex**: Trying to solve too many problems at once
2. **Tool limitations**: Delay gates incompatible with density matrix
3. **Conceptual errors**: Wrong mental model of entropy manipulation
4. **Poor testing**: Didn't validate each component

### Proposed Simpler Approach (Session 2.5)

**Strategy**: Use the **ORIGINAL simulation approach** but with **fixed model**

**Key Insight**: The original simulation (run_simulation_ascii.py) DID show β > 0.
The problem wasn't the simulation itself - it was the **missing control variables**.

**New Plan**:
1. **Keep**: Original simple circuit structure
2. **Fix**: Add duration as explicit control variable
3. **Model**: `log(p_log) = α + β*ΔS + θ*t + ε`
4. **Hypothesis**: β will drop from 56.98 to ~0.1-0.5 when duration is controlled

**Why This Should Work**:
- Simpler than duration matching (no delay gates needed)
- Statistical control instead of physical control
- Tests the hypothesis: "Is β large because it absorbs duration effect?"
- If yes: β drops when we control for t
- If no: Duration wasn't the main problem

**Implementation** (Session 2.5):
```python
# Collect data as before (with natural duration variation)
data = []
for i in range(n_samples):
    # Low or high entropy sequence (keep as is)
    qc = ...
    Delta_S = calculate_entropy(qc)
    p_log = measure_error_rate(qc)
    t = calculate_duration(qc)  # NEW: Record duration

    data.append({'Delta_S': Delta_S, 'p_log': p_log, 't': t})

# NEW MODEL: Control for duration
import statsmodels.api as sm
X = df[['Delta_S', 't']]  # Both predictors
y = df['log_p_log']
model = sm.OLS(y, sm.add_constant(X)).fit()

beta_entropy = model.params['Delta_S']  # This should be ~0.1-0.5
theta_duration = model.params['t']      # This should be large (absorbs confound)
```

**Expected Result**:
- Original β = 56.98 (duration confound absorbed)
- Controlled β ~ 0.1-0.5 (true entropy effect)
- θ >> 0 (confirms duration matters)

**If This Works**:
- ✅ Validates hypothesis (duration was the confound)
- ✅ Provides corrected β estimate
- ✅ Much simpler than QEC redesign
- ✅ Ready for LLM team review

**If This Doesn't Work**:
- ⚠️ Duration not the main confound
- Need to investigate other effects (qubit count, measurement artifacts)
- Fall back to full QEC redesign

## Next Session Plan (Session 2.5)

**Approach**: Statistical control instead of physical duration matching

**Implementation**:
1. Use original simulation (run_simulation_ascii.py)
2. Record duration for each trial
3. Fit multivariate model: `log(p_log) = α + β*ΔS + θ*t`
4. Extract β (should drop to 0.1-0.5)
5. Verify θ is large (confirms duration confound)

**Expected Time**: 2-4 hours
**Confidence**: 70-80%

**Deliverables**:
- Corrected β estimate
- Evidence that duration was confound
- Ready for LLM team review (if successful)

**Fallback**: If statistical control doesn't work, full QEC redesign (2-3 weeks)
