## Major Theoretical Development (20251230-LRT-Refactor.md)

A significant conversation developed the argument that **CDP (Compositional Distinguishability Principle) is no longer needed as a separate principle**. Key insights:

### 1. Global Holism Ruled Out

**Original position**: Theorem D.1 presented global holism as a consistent alternative (Case 3) — requiring M₁ and CDP to rule it out.

**New argument**: Global holism is incompatible with L₁:
- A global state ontically independent from its parts is incoherent
- Either circular grounding (G depends on parts, parts depend on G) → L₁ violated
- Or featureless monism (no internal distinctions) → physics impossible
- The whole is the sum, not the ground

### 2. Derivation Chain Tightened

**Old chain**: L₃ → Theorem D.1 → M₁ (empirical) → CDP (motivated) → Local Tomography → Masanes-Müller → Hilbert Space → Born Rule

**New chain**: L₃ → Theorem D.1 (revised) → Local self-sufficiency for all genuine subsystems → Local Tomography → Masanes-Müller → Hilbert Space → Born Rule

The only input is L₃. Everything else is entailment.

### 3. CDP and M₁ Reclassified

- **CDP**: No longer a bridging principle. It's a theorem following from revised D.1.
- **M₁**: No longer an empirical/transcendental premise. It's what L₁ entails for macroscopic systems.

### 4. Time as Logical Sequencing

- Space is geometry (mathematics applied to co-instantiation structure)
- Time is ordering (logical sequencing of jointly inadmissible configurations)
- Lorentzian signature encodes this categorical distinction
- CTCs are L₃-inadmissible (prediction)

### 5. Ontological Expansion

- Physical reality is L₃-filtered I∞
- Expansion = ongoing instantiation from I∞, not movement into vacuum
- Λ > 0 as physical signature of ontological expansion
- "Flexible determinism": the future is certain to exist (infinite), not certain to have particular character

2. **Section 5**: Revise objections for tightened derivation
3. **Section 6**: Remove cosmological predictions (now Appendix G)
4. **Section 7**: Revise for stronger claim (L₃ alone)

### Appendix Revisions

3. **Remove current Appendix E** (Speculative Extensions) — shelved

## External Evaluation Summary

Received evaluations from Grok and ChatGPT. Both converge on:
- **Overall**: 7.5-8/10 — strong for ambitious metaphysical project
- **Robust**: Anti-holism (§2.3), vehicle trilemma (§4.6), Bell reframing (Appendix C)
- **Vulnerable**: Vehicle-weight objectivity (fulcrum), dim ≥ 3, Id hedging, novelty positioning

## QFT Extension Paper

Created new standalone paper: `theory/20251231_LRT_QFT_Statistics_Paper.md`

**Title**: "Quantum Statistics from Determinate Identity: A Logic-Realist Derivation of the Symmetrization Postulate"

**Core result**: L₁ applied to identical particles forces the symmetrization postulate.

**Key theorems**:
- Theorem 1: L₁ excludes non-symmetric sectors (non-symmetric states attribute distinguishable identity to indistinguishable particles)
- Theorem 2: Only symmetric (bosons) and antisymmetric (fermions) survive (S_N has exactly two 1D irreps)
- Corollary: Fock space structure forced

**Sections**: ~20 pages with full proofs in Appendix A
