1. Major strategic pivot: "derivation" → "structural fine-tuning"
2. Created 5-paper framework (~3,500 lines)
3. Paper 1 multi-LLM validated (0.70)
4. Scorecard rewritten (31/40)
5. AI methodology doc refocused
6. Repository restructured and cleaned
7. AI-Collaboration-Profile updated to v2.0.0

**Pending from Session 15.0**:
- Multi-LLM consultation for Papers 2-5
- T2/T1 prediction decision (include/modify/retire)
- Lean/Notebook alignment audit
- Publication track planning

## Current Repository State

**5-Paper Framework**:
```
theory/
├── LRT_Paper1_Logic_Realism_Theory.md        # Philosophy (568 lines) - validated 0.70
├── LRT_Paper2_It_From_Bit_Bit_From_Fit.md    # Physics (777 lines) - pending
├── LRT_Paper3_Mathematical_Structure.md      # Mathematics (~800 lines) - pending
├── LRT_Paper4_Empirical_Signatures.md        # Predictions (612 lines) - pending
├── LRT_Paper5_Consilience.md                 # Cross-domain (761 lines) - pending
```

**Key Resources**:
- `AI-Collaboration-Profile.json` (v2.0.0) - Enhanced operating instructions
- `LRT_Current_Comparison_Scorecard.md` - LRT at 31/40
- `Logic_Realism_Theory_AI_Experiment.md` - Methodology only
