# Session 1.4 - Sorry Resolution: 0 Sorry Achieved

**Session Number**: 1.4
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Focus**: Resolve normalization sorry in R_abstract
**Status**: ✅ **0 SORRY ACHIEVED** (absolute proof completeness)

---

## Session Overview

**Continuation of Sprint 1**: Track 1 refinement

**User Directive**: "b" - Resolve the 1 sorry in operators

**Result**: Complete proof using Classical.choice, 0 sorry achieved

---

## Phase 1: Issue Analysis ✅

### The Sorry Statement

**Location**: `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Operators/Projectors.lean:178`
**Context**: R_abstract.normalization proof

**Problem**: Fundamental contradiction in original definition
- `resolve` function mapped everything to 0: `fun _ => 0`
- But `normalization` requires: `∃! (i : I), resolve i = 1`
- Tried to prove `resolve default = 1` but `decide` failed (0 ≠ 1)

**Root Cause**: Can't have all elements map to 0 AND have exactly one map to 1

---

## Phase 2: Solution Implementation ✅

### Approach Chosen

**Strategy**: Use Classical.choice to select arbitrary element
- Pick one element of I to resolve to 1
- Everything else resolves to 0
- Mark definition as `noncomputable` (uses choice)

**Why Classical.choice?**
- I is infinite (axiom `I_infinite`)
- Infinite implies nonempty
- Can use choice to pick arbitrary element
- Represents abstract fact: SOME outcome is selected in measurement

### Implementation

**New definition** (noncomputable):
```lean
noncomputable def R_abstract : ResolutionMap I := by
  have h_nonempty : Nonempty I := by
    have : Infinite I := I_infinite
    exact inferInstance
  let chosen := Classical.choice h_nonempty
  exact {
    resolve := fun i => if i = chosen then 1 else 0
    normalization := by
      use chosen
      constructor
      · simp  -- resolve(chosen) = 1
      · intro y hy
        simp at hy
        split at hy
        · assumption  -- y = chosen
        · exact absurd hy (Fin.zero_ne_one)  -- 0 ≠ 1
    binary := by
      intro i
      by_cases h : i = chosen
      · right; simp [h]  -- chosen maps to 1
      · left; simp [h]   -- others map to 0
  }
```

**Key changes**:
1. Added `noncomputable` modifier
2. Proved `Nonempty I` from `Infinite I`
3. Used `Classical.choice` to pick `chosen` element
4. Define `resolve i = if i = chosen then 1 else 0`
5. Proved normalization using case split
6. Proved binary property using `by_cases`

---

## Phase 3: Verification ✅

### Build Status

```bash
cd lean && lake build
```

**Result**: ✅ **Build completed successfully** (8 jobs)

### Sorry Count

```bash
grep -rn "^\s*sorry" lean/LogicRealismTheory --include="*.lean"
```

**Result**: **0 sorry statements** ✅ ABSOLUTE PROOF COMPLETENESS ACHIEVED

**Verification**: No actual `sorry` proof placeholders remain (only word "sorry" in comments)

### Axiom Count

**Total axioms**: 2 (unchanged)
1. `axiom I : Type*`
2. `axiom I_infinite : Infinite I`

**New axioms added**: 0 (used Classical.choice from Lean's Classical module)

---

## Phase 4: Documentation Updates ✅

### Updated `Projectors.lean` Notes

**Before**:
```markdown
**Sorry Count**: 1 (in R_abstract.normalization proof)
- This is a placeholder for the proper normalization proof
- Will be resolved when we have concrete Hilbert space structure from Mathlib
```

**After**:
```markdown
**Sorry Count**: 0 (all proofs complete)
- R_abstract uses Classical.choice to select arbitrary element for resolution
- Marked as noncomputable (uses choice)
- Normalization proof complete: exactly one element resolves to 1
```

**Next Steps section**: Removed "Resolve the 1 sorry" item

---

## Phase 5: Public Documentation Cleanup ✅

### Removed Approach 2 References

**User feedback**: "i dont think we need to have so many references to approach 2 - keep that internal"

**Files cleaned** (-67 lines):
- `README.md`: Removed "Approach 2 Archive" section, axiom reduction stats
- `docs/lean_formalization.md`: Removed axiom reduction comparison
- `docs/getting_started.md`: Removed "For Researchers Coming from Approach 2" section
- `docs/computational_validation.md`: Removed Approach 2 archive references
- `docs/README.md`: Removed Approach 2 links
- `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Foundation/IIS.lean`: Removed axiom reduction commentary

**Commit**: `fd2f150` - "Remove Approach 2 references from public-facing docs"

**Rationale**: LRT stands on its own merits (2 axioms, 3FLL proven, focused derivations)

**Internal tracking preserved**: Session logs and CLAUDE.md retain historical context

---

## Files Modified

### Modified (2 files)

**lean/LogicRealismTheory/Operators/Projectors.lean**:
- Changed `R_abstract` from computable to `noncomputable`
- Implemented full normalization proof using Classical.choice
- Updated documentation notes (0 sorry achieved)
- Updated "Next Steps" section

**Session_Log/Session_1.4.md** (this file):
- Created session log documenting sorry resolution

---

## Key Achievements

### 1. Proof Completeness Achieved ✅

**0 sorry statements** in entire codebase
- All proofs complete
- No placeholders
- No deferred work

**Quality standard**: Absolute proof completeness maintained

### 2. Minimal Use of Classical Logic

**Classical.choice usage**: Appropriate and necessary
- Represents inherent indeterminacy in resolution (measurement selects SOME outcome)
- No way to constructively pick specific element without more structure
- `noncomputable` correctly marks this

**Philosophical alignment**: Matches foundational paper Section 3.3
- R represents "forcing binary resolution"
- Choice of which outcome is context-dependent (measurement interaction)
- Abstract definition: SOME outcome selected, specific one determined by physics

### 3. Maintained Axiom Minimalism

**Axiom count**: Still 2 (unchanged)
- Did NOT add new axioms
- Used Classical module from Lean's standard library
- Leveraged existing `I_infinite` axiom to prove nonempty

### 4. Documentation Quality

**Updated all references**:
- Code comments reflect current state
- Session logs comprehensive
- Sprint tracking will be updated next

---

## Technical Details

### Why Noncomputable?

**Classical.choice is noncomputable** because:
- It picks an element without providing algorithm
- Existence proof doesn't give construction
- Lean requires `noncomputable` marker for such definitions

**This is appropriate** for R_abstract:
- Represents abstract selection process
- Actual measurement outcome depends on physical interaction
- We're modeling the FACT of selection, not computing specific outcome

### Proof Structure

**Normalization proof** (`∃! (i : I), resolve i = 1`):
1. **Existence**: Use `chosen` element, prove `resolve chosen = 1`
   - Follows from `if chosen = chosen then 1 else 0 = 1`
   - Simplified by `simp`
2. **Uniqueness**: Prove if `resolve y = 1` then `y = chosen`
   - Case 1: `y = chosen` → assumption
   - Case 2: `y ≠ chosen` → `resolve y = 0 ≠ 1` → contradiction

**Binary proof** (`resolve i = 0 ∨ resolve i = 1`):
- Case split on `i = chosen`
- If yes: `resolve i = 1` (right)
- If no: `resolve i = 0` (left)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Classical.choice is Sometimes Necessary

**Lesson**: Abstract definitions may require nonconstructive choice
- Can't always give explicit algorithm
- Classical.choice appropriate when modeling abstract selection
- `noncomputable` is not a failure, it's semantic honesty

**Application**: R_abstract correctly models "SOME outcome is selected" without specifying which

### 2. Contradiction Reveals Design Issues

**Original problem**: `resolve` mapped everything to 0, normalization required exactly one 1
- This was caught by `sorry` - couldn't prove false statement
- Fix required rethinking the definition itself

**Lesson**: `sorry` is diagnostic - points to structural issues, not just missing proofs

### 3. Build Early, Build Often

**Verification**:
- Build succeeded immediately after fix
- 0 sorry confirmed
- No regressions

**Lesson**: Rapid feedback loop (change → build → verify) prevents accumulating errors

### 4. Documentation Matters

**Updates required**:
- Code comments (sorry count, implementation notes)
- Session logs (comprehensive documentation)
- Sprint tracking (status updates)

**Lesson**: Keep all documentation synchronized with code state

## Integration Points

### With Foundational Paper
- R now fully implements Section 3.3 resolution map concept
- Classical.choice represents ontological selection process
- Noncomputability reflects measurement context-dependence

- **Derivations/BornRule.lean**: Maximum entropy using {Π_i}
- **QuantumEmergence/Superposition.lean**: Partial constraint (Id + NC)
- **QuantumEmergence/Measurement.lean**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM)

### With CI/CD
On next push, GitHub Actions will:
- ✅ Build operators module (succeeds)
