# Session 19.0

**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Focus**: Recovery from crash; continue Master Paper synthesis
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## Context from Session 18.0

**Session 18.0 Achievements**:
1. Completed Part III: Sections 16-22 (Mathematical Structure)
2. Added Section 16.8: Axiom 3 Derivation Status
3. Investigated Approach F (Logical Time) and Parsimony Bridge
4. Discovered scope gap: Parsimony governs Boolean actuality, not IIS dynamics
5. Conducted multi-LLM consultation on scope gap
6. Created ISSUE 001 (Axiom 3 Grounding) - definitive GPT-revised version
7. Created ISSUE 002 (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) - future work

**Key Findings from Session 18.0**:

| Sub-Axiom | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Reversibility (3b) | **DERIVED** | Conditional on CBP (Consistency Bridging Principle) |
| Continuity (3a) | Motivated only | No derivation |
| Local Tomography (3c) | Independent axiom | Almost certainly irreducible |

**LRT Reconstruction Hierarchy (proposed)**:
- Tier 0: 3FLL, IIS, distinguishability, Boolean actuality, Parsimony theorem
- Tier 1: CBP → Reversibility (derived)
- Tier 2: Continuity + Local Tomography (physical axioms)
- Tier 3: Hilbert space → Born rule → QM structure

**Outstanding ISSUE 001 Close Conditions**:
- [ ] CBP added to manuscript
- [ ] Reversibility theorem written and cross-referenced
- [ ] Continuity marked as conjectural, not derived
- [ ] Local tomography explicitly identified as irreducible
- [ ] Reconstruction chain updated
- [ ] Section 16 revision merged

## Work Completed

### 1. ISSUE 001 Closure

Completed all close conditions for ISSUE 001 (Axiom 3 Grounding):

| Close Condition | Implementation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| CBP added to manuscript | Section 6.2, Definition 6.1 |
| Reversibility theorem | Section 16.7, Theorem 16.12 |
| Continuity marked conjectural | Section 16.8, "MOTIVATED" |
| Local tomography irreducible | Section 16.8, "IRREDUCIBLE" |
| Reconstruction chain updated | Section 18.10, tier-based diagram |
| Section 16 revision | 16.6 revised table, 16.7 theorem added |

**Key Changes to Master Paper:**

1. **Section 16.2**: Added "[DERIVED - see Theorem 16.12]" to Axiom 3(b)
2. **Section 16.6**: Revised axiom structure table showing:
   - A3a (Continuity) as Axiom (Tier 2 - motivated)
   - A3c (Local Tomography) as Axiom (Tier 2 - physical)
   - P3 (CBP) as Principle (Section 6)
   - T2 (Reversibility) as Theorem (from CBP + T1)
3. **Section 16.7**: NEW - The Reversibility Theorem (Theorem 16.12)
   - Full proof from CBP + Parsimony
   - Corollary 16.13 (unitarity)
4. **Section 16.8**: Updated derivation status table
   - Reversibility: "DERIVED (Theorem 16.12)"
   - Local Tomography: "IRREDUCIBLE"
5. **Section 18.10**: Complete tier-based derivation chain diagram
   - Tier 0: Logical/Informational foundations
   - Tier 1: Bridging (CBP → Reversibility)
   - Tier 2: Physical axioms (Continuity, Local Tomography)
   - Tier 3: Derived structure (Hilbert space, Born rule)

**Final LRT Reconstruction Hierarchy:**

```
Tier 0: 3FLL, IIS, distinguishability, Boolean actuality, Parsimony (T1)
   ↓
Tier 1: CBP → Reversibility (T2, derived)
   ↓
Tier 2: Continuity (motivated) + Local Tomography (axiom)
   ↓
Tier 3: Hilbert space → Born rule → QM
```
