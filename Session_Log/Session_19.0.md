# Session 19.0

**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Focus**: Recovery from crash; continue Master Paper synthesis
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Context from Session 18.0

**Session 18.0 Achievements**:
1. Completed Part III: Sections 16-22 (Mathematical Structure)
2. Added Section 16.8: Axiom 3 Derivation Status
3. Investigated Approach F (Logical Time) and Parsimony Bridge
4. Discovered scope gap: Parsimony governs Boolean actuality, not IIS dynamics
5. Conducted multi-LLM consultation on scope gap
6. Created ISSUE 001 (Axiom 3 Grounding) - definitive GPT-revised version
7. Created ISSUE 002 (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) - future work

**Key Findings from Session 18.0**:

| Sub-Axiom | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Reversibility (3b) | **DERIVED** | Conditional on CBP (Consistency Bridging Principle) |
| Continuity (3a) | Motivated only | No derivation |
| Local Tomography (3c) | Independent axiom | Almost certainly irreducible |

**LRT Reconstruction Hierarchy (proposed)**:
- Tier 0: 3FLL, IIS, distinguishability, Boolean actuality, Parsimony theorem
- Tier 1: CBP → Reversibility (derived)
- Tier 2: Continuity + Local Tomography (physical axioms)
- Tier 3: Hilbert space → Born rule → QM structure

**Outstanding ISSUE 001 Close Conditions**:
- [ ] CBP added to manuscript
- [ ] Reversibility theorem written and cross-referenced
- [ ] Continuity marked as conjectural, not derived
- [ ] Local tomography explicitly identified as irreducible
- [ ] Reconstruction chain updated
- [ ] Section 16 revision merged
