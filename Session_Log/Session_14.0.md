# Session 14.0: Cleanup, Organization & Paper Revamps

**Date**: 2025-11-06
**Focus**: Repository cleanup, organization, and paper updates following Session 13.0 derivation work
**Status**: In progress - Awaiting guided actions

---

## Context

Following Session 13.0's major achievement (variational framework 98% derived), this session focuses on:
- Cleanup tasks
- Repository organization
- Paper revamps to reflect new derivation status

**Previous Session**: Session 13.0 - Variational Framework Derivation (0% → 98%)

---

## Session Plan

Awaiting user-guided actions for:
1. Cleanup tasks
2. Organization improvements
3. Paper revamps and updates

---

## Work Log

### Initialization

**Session Started**: 2025-11-06
**Previous Achievement**: Variational framework 98% derived with expert validation
**Repository State**: Clean (all Session 13.0 work committed and pushed)

### Lean Folder Documentation Review (Files 1-3/9)

**Files Reviewed**:
1. ✅ **AXIOMS.md** - Updated with Session 13.0 derivations
   - Added variational framework to "What LRT Proves" section
   - Added cross-references to theory/derivations/ files
   - Updated date to 2025-11-06

2. ✅ **AXIOM_CLASSIFICATION_SYSTEM.md** - No updates needed
   - Pure methodology doc (3-tier framework)
   - No derivation-specific content
   - Remains active as framework reference

3. ✅ **PROOF_REFACTOR_STRATEGY.md** - Added Session 13.0 note
   - Added "Future Formalization Targets" section
   - Links mathematical derivations to future Lean work
   - Notes ~10-15 additional theorems for formalization

**Files 4-8 Reviewed**:
4. ✅ **STANDARD_FILE_HEADER.md** - No updates needed (pure formatting guide)
5. ✅ **TIER_LABELING_QUICK_START.md** - No updates needed (pure methodology)
6. ⚠️ **LRT_Comprehensive_Lean_Plan.md** - ARCHIVED (never executed, superseded by Sprint 16)
7. ⚠️ **Ongoing_Axiom_Count_Classification.md** - ARCHIVED (extracted framing to AXIOMS.md)
8. ✅ **lean/README.md** - UPDATED to current status
   - Added Session 13.0 variational framework as future Lean targets
   - Updated dates, sprint status, session references
   - Fixed references to archived files
   - **⚠️ MAINTENANCE DOC** - Keep updated with new derivations and Lean work

**Archived**: 3 files total (PROOF_REFACTOR_STRATEGY_OLD.md, LRT_Comprehensive_Lean_Plan.md, Ongoing_Axiom_Count_Classification.md)

**TODO**: Discuss derivation strategy before paper revamp
