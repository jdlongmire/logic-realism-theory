## Final LRT Reconstruction Hierarchy

```
Tier 0: 3FLL, IIS, distinguishability, Boolean actuality, Parsimony (T1)
   ↓
Tier 1: CBP → Reversibility (T2, derived)
   ↓
Tier 2: Continuity (motivated) + Local Tomography (axiom)
   ↓
Tier 3: Hilbert space → Schrödinger dynamics → Born rule → QM
```

## Session 20.0 Accomplishments

### 1. Section 27.8: Distinctive Predictions of LRT

**Status: COMPLETE**

Added new subsection to Section 27 (Novel Predictions) with 5 distinctive LRT predictions:

| Prediction | Type | Time Horizon | Falsifiability |
|------------|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1. No underivable collapse constants | Falsifier | 5–20 years | High |
| 2. Collapse rate from geometry/info | Positive forecast | 5–20 years | High |
| 3. Exact saturation of bounds | Conditional (S = ℏC) | 10–30 years | Medium |
| 4. No recoherence after actualization | Distinctive | Long-term | Medium |
| 5. ℂ breakdown tied to tomography | Distinctive | Long-term | High |

**Key refinements applied:**
- "Derivable" explicitly defined as structural constraint (not computational claim)
- Predictions 1 & 2 separated as falsifier vs positive forecast
- Prediction 4 sharpened with actualization criterion (stable, redundantly-encoded macroscopic record)
- Prediction 3 explicitly marked conditional on S = ℏC
- Removed editorial rhetoric per V&V feedback

**Significance:** Moves LRT from purely explanatory framework to empirically testable research program with concrete near-term stakes in macroscopic quantum experiments.
