## Context from Session 19.0

**Session 19.0 Achievements**:
1. Closed ISSUE 001 (Axiom 3 Grounding)
2. Closed ISSUE 002 (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) - Added Section 17.10-17.11
3. Created ISSUE 003 (Lean 4 Formalization) - PLANNED for post-first-draft
4. Completed Part IV: Empirical Signatures (Sections 23-30)
5. Expanded Problem 22.7 with conditional resolution path

## Final LRT Reconstruction Hierarchy

```
Tier 0: 3FLL, IIS, distinguishability, Boolean actuality, Parsimony (T1)
   ↓
Tier 1: CBP → Reversibility (T2, derived)
   ↓
Tier 2: Continuity (motivated) + Local Tomography (axiom)
   ↓
Tier 3: Hilbert space → Schrödinger dynamics → Born rule → QM
```

## Next Steps

Ready to begin **Part V: Implications & Extensions** (Sections 31-41)

Awaiting user direction.
