# Session 31.0

**Date**: 2025-11-29
**Focus**: Gap 1 - IIS Physical Interpretation
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Interaction Count**: 1

## Context

From `theory/PAPER_RESTRUCTURING_STRATEGY.md`:

**Gap 1: IIS Physical Interpretation** (Priority 1, Low Risk, High Value)

**Location**: Technical §3.4 (new), Main §3 (summary)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Example 1: Single qubit / Bloch sphere
- [ ] Example 2: Two-slit experiment
- [ ] Example 3: General n-dimensional system
- [ ] Example 4: Composite systems / entanglement
- [ ] Main paper summary paragraph

**Output**: 2-3 pages in Technical, 1 page in Main

**Acceptance criteria**: Reader can connect abstract IIS definition to concrete quantum systems

**Time estimate**: 2-3 weeks

## Current State

**Technical paper** (`Logic_Realism_Theory_Technical.md`):
- §3.1: Distinguishability Relation (Definition 2.1)
- §3.2: Distinguishability Metric (Definition 2.2, Theorem 2.1)
- §3.3: Direct Reconstruction of Inner Product from D
- No §3.4 exists - needs to be created

**Main paper** (`Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md`):
- §2.2: Infinite Information Space (functional characterization)
- Has mathematical definition but lacks concrete physical examples
