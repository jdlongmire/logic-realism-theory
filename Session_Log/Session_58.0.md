## Work Products

### theory_development_and_discussion.md
Key extractions:
- **Contextual Actuality Principle**: L₃ applies to actual outcomes, not counterfactuals
- **Theorem 1 (Bell Compatibility)**: Classical logic + Bell violations compatible
- **Theorem 2 (Logical Reformulation)**: Quantum setup = outcome propositions + Born probabilities
- **Gates as Logical Transformers**: Novel QC application
- **Blueprint Principle**: Formalizes R(I) → L(I) mapping
- **Integration opportunities** identified for existing papers

### Integration Results (Parallel Agent Execution)

**1. MVS Paper §4.5 - Bell Tests and Contextual Actuality**
- Added new subsection explaining compatibility with Bell violations
- L₃ applies to actual outcomes only, not counterfactual settings
- No global hidden variable assignment required

**2. Technical Foundations Appendix C - Bell Compatibility Theorem**
- Formal theorem statement with proof sketch
- Mathematical formalization of Contextual Actuality
- References to Bell 1964, Kochen-Specker 1967

**3. NEW: 20260109_LRT_Quantum_Computing.md**
- Complete working paper: "Quantum Computing from Determinate Identity"
- Gates as logical transformers (H, CNOT examples)
- Entanglement as structured correlation
- Error correction as logical constraint protection
- LRT advantages for QC

**4. QFT Statistics Paper §7 - Error Correction**
- Stabilizer codes as logical constraints
- Decoherence as constraint violation
- Syndrome measurement as logical verification
- Subsequent sections renumbered
