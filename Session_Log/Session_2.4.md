# Session 2.4 - Quantum Simulation: Initial Signal, Critical Discrepancy Found

**Session Number**: 2.4
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Focus**: Quantum simulation of entropy-error correlation (LRT prediction testing)
**Status**: ⚠️ INCONCLUSIVE - Model discrepancy requires investigation

---

## Session Overview

**Session Continuation**: Started from Session 2.3 (Sprint 2 complete, citations corrected)

**Primary Objectives**:
1. Create quantum simulation testing LRT's entropy-error correlation prediction
2. Validate protocol feasibility before IBM Quantum hardware deployment
3. Assess IBM Quantum free tier capabilities

**Critical Outcome**: Simulation produced positive β > 0, but with **massive discrepancy** from paper's prediction (100x-500x larger). This is a red flag requiring investigation.

---

## Major Problems and Inconsistencies (Per Auditor Protocol)

### 1. Massive Effect Size Discrepancy ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Simulation Result**: β = 56.985 ± 22.789
**Paper Prediction**: β ~ 0.1 - 0.5 (Section 4, lines 310-407)
**Discrepancy**: **100x to 500x larger than predicted**

**Assessment**: The simulated effect is far too large. This strongly suggests:
- The "simplified model" is mis-specified
- An artifact or confound is being captured
- Not measuring the subtle constraint-relaxation effect described in theory

**Conclusion**: This is NOT validation. This is a **model failure**.

### 2. Insufficient Sample Size ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Simulation n**: 30 samples
**Paper Requirement N**: 10^4 - 10^5 gate cycles
**Discrepancy**: **300x - 3000x below requirement**

**Assessment**: n=30 is statistically meaningless for this claim, even with low p-value. Highly prone to false positives (Type I errors).

**Conclusion**: Sample size insufficient for any scientific conclusion.

### 3. Violation of Auditor Rule 5 (Hype) ❌ VIOLATION

**Initial Claims** (RETRACTED):
- ❌ "Excellent results!"
- ❌ "Supports LRT prediction"
- ❌ "First evidence for entropy-error correlation"
- ❌ "REJECT H0 (β = 0)"

**Auditor Assessment**: These claims are **factually incorrect** given:
- 100x-500x effect size discrepancy
- Insufficient sample size
- No investigation of model validity

**Corrected Assessment**:
- ✅ "Initial signal detected (β > 0)"
- ✅ "Model discrepancy requires investigation (β 100x too large)"
- ✅ "Sample size insufficient for conclusions (n=30 << 10^4)"
- ✅ "Protocol implementation validated on simulator"

## Quantitative Assessment

| Metric | Paper Requirement | Simulation Result | Assessment |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Sample Size** | N ~ 10,000 - 100,000 | n = 30 | **FAIL** |
| **β Coefficient** | β ~ 0.1 - 0.5 | β ~ 57.0 | **FAIL** |
| **Hypothesis** | β > 0 | β > 0 (p = 0.0185) | **INCONCLUSIVE** |
| **Code Distance** | d = 3, 5, 7 varied | d = 3 fixed | **INCOMPLETE** |
| **Physical Error Rate** | p_phys varied | p_phys = 10^-3 fixed | **INCOMPLETE** |

## What Actually Happened (Factual)

### Phase 1: IBM Quantum Feasibility Research

**Question**: Can LRT's prediction be tested with IBM Quantum free tier?

**Research Conducted**:
- Read foundational paper (Section 4, lines 310-407)
- Web search for latest IBM Quantum documentation
- Verified Qiskit 2.x capabilities

**Findings**:
- **Simulators**: ✅ Unlimited free access
- **Hardware**: ⚠️ Limited (~10 min/month on free tier)
- **Full Validation**: Requires enhanced access (10^4-10^5 samples)
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Feasible on simulators

**Conclusion**: Simulator validation necessary before hardware deployment.

### Phase 2: Protocol Implementation

**Created**: `notebooks/quantum_simulations/01_Entropy_Error_Correlation_Test.ipynb`

**Structure** (1,022 lines):
1. Noise model configuration (IBM realistic parameters)
2. Entropy manipulation sequences (low vs high ΔS)
3. Entropy tracking via density matrix
4. Simplified surface code (3-qubit repetition)
5. Error rate simulation
6. Statistical analysis
7. Visualization
8. Summary and hardware deployment template

**Statistical Model** (SIMPLIFIED):
```
log(p_log) = α + β * ΔS
```

**Missing Terms** (from paper's full model):
- Code distance: γ(d)
- Physical error rate scaling: η log(p_phys)
- Gate count normalization
- Circuit depth effects

**Assessment**: Model simplification likely source of β discrepancy.

### Phase 3: Simulation Execution

**Challenges**:
1. Unicode encoding errors (Windows terminal cp1252)
   - Fixed: Created ASCII-only version
2. API changes (Qiskit 2.x: `simulator.name` is property, not method)
   - Fixed: Updated API calls

**Created**: `notebooks/quantum_simulations/run_simulation_ascii.py`

**Execution**: Successful (no crashes)

**Results**:
```
β = 56.9850 ± 22.7893
p-value = 0.0185
R² = 0.1825
n = 30 samples
```

**Plot**: `notebooks/outputs/entropy_error_correlation_simulation.png`
- Left panel: Low-entropy (blue) vs high-entropy (red) sequences
- Right panel: Log-linear fit with positive slope

### Phase 4: Critical Review (This Phase)

**Reviewer Feedback**: Applied Program_Auditor_Agent protocol

**Major Issues Identified**:
1. β discrepancy (100x-500x too large)
2. Sample size insufficient (n=30 << 10^4)
3. Hype language violation (auditor Rule 5)

**Actions Taken**:
1. Retracted overclaimed statements
2. Created Session 2.4 log with honest assessment
3. Marked status as INCONCLUSIVE
4. Identified model investigation as top priority

## What This Simulation Actually Validated ✅

**Positive Outcomes** (factual, conservative):
1. ✅ Protocol implementable on Qiskit 2.x
2. ✅ Entropy tracking works (density matrix method)
3. ✅ Low-entropy vs high-entropy sequences distinguishable
4. ✅ Statistical analysis pipeline functional
5. ✅ Simulation runs without errors on Windows
6. ✅ Latest IBM Quantum tools compatible

**Technical Achievement**: Proof-of-concept infrastructure is working.

---

## What This Simulation Did NOT Validate ❌

**False Claims** (retracted):
1. ❌ Evidence for LRT prediction (β magnitude wrong)
2. ❌ Statistically significant result (n too small)
3. ❌ Rejection of null hypothesis (inconclusive)
4. ❌ Ready for hardware deployment (model needs fixing)

**Scientific Assessment**: This is NOT a validation of LRT. This is a model discrepancy requiring investigation.

---

## Root Cause Analysis: Why β Is 100x Too Large

### Hypothesis 1: Missing Normalization Terms

**Paper's Full Model**:
```
log(p_log) = α + γ(d) + η log(p_phys) + β ΔS_sys + ε
```

**Simulation's Model**:
```
log(p_log) = α + β ΔS
```

**Problem**: Missing γ(d) and η log(p_phys) terms means β absorbs their effects, inflating the coefficient.

**Fix**: Implement full model with code distance and physical error rate as independent variables.

### Hypothesis 2: Entropy Scaling Issue

**Theory**: β ~ 0.1-0.5 means ~10-50% error increase per nat of entropy

**Simulation**: β ~ 57 would imply ~10^24% error increase per nat (absurd)

**Problem**: Entropy change ΔS might be incorrectly measured or scaled.

**Possible Issues**:
- Using total system entropy instead of relevant subsystem
- Not normalizing by circuit depth
- Noise model entropy conflated with logical entropy

**Fix**: Verify entropy calculation matches paper's definition (von Neumann entropy of logical qubit subsystem).

### Hypothesis 3: Error Rate Measurement Conflation

**Paper**: Measure logical error rate p_log (majority vote failure)

**Simulation**: Measures bitwise errors, applies majority vote

**Problem**: Simplified 3-qubit repetition code may conflate:
- Logical errors (correctable failures)
- Physical errors (gate/measurement noise)
- Syndrome extraction errors

**Fix**: Implement full surface code d=3 with proper syndrome extraction (qiskit-qec).

### Hypothesis 4: Statistical Artifact (Small n)

**n=30**: With such small sample, random fluctuations can create spurious correlations

**R² = 0.18**: Only 18% of variance explained (weak fit despite "significant" p-value)

**Problem**: Type I error (false positive) highly likely with n=30

**Fix**: Increase to n=1,000 minimum (after model fixes).

## Recommendations (Per Auditor Protocol)

### Immediate Actions (COMPLETED)

1. ✅ **Retract Claims**: Removed "Excellent results!" and "Supports LRT prediction" from documentation
2. ✅ **Update Session Log**: Created Session 2.4 with honest assessment
3. ✅ **Mark Status**: INCONCLUSIVE - Model discrepancy requires investigation

### Next Steps (REQUIRED Before Any Claims)

**Priority 1: Investigate Model Discrepancy** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Tasks**:
1. Implement full statistical model:
   ```
   log(p_log) = α + γ(d) + η log(p_phys) + β ΔS_sys + ε
   ```
2. Vary code distance d = 3, 5, 7
3. Vary physical error rate p_phys
4. Verify entropy measurement:
   - Use logical qubit subsystem only

   - Separate noise entropy from logical entropy
5. Implement full surface code (qiskit-qec)

**Expected Outcome**: β should drop to ~0.1-0.5 range if model is correct.

**Priority 2: Scale Sample Size** (After model fix)

**Tasks**:
1. Increase n to 1,000 (minimum)
2. Target n = 10,000 for full validation
3. Run convergence tests (verify β stabilizes)

**Priority 3: Hardware Validation** (After model fix + scaling)

**Tasks**:
1. Apply for IBM Quantum enhanced access
2. Run on real quantum hardware
3. Compare simulator vs hardware results

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Apply Auditor Protocol BEFORE Making Claims ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Mistake**: I claimed "Excellent results!" and "Supports LRT prediction" before critical analysis.

**Correct Process**:
1. Run simulation
2. Get results
3. **STOP - Apply auditor protocol**
4. Check for discrepancies vs predictions
5. Verify sample size sufficiency
6. Only then make conservative, factual claims

**Rule**: Always start with "What's wrong?" before celebrating "What works?"

### 2. Effect Size Matters More Than p-value

**Mistake**: Focused on p=0.0185 (< 0.05) without checking β magnitude.

**Correct Process**:
1. Check effect size first (β ~ 0.1-0.5 expected)
2. If wildly off, investigate model before trusting p-value
3. p-value alone is meaningless if effect size is wrong

**Rule**: Effect size verification precedes hypothesis testing.

### 3. Model Validation Before Statistical Analysis

**Mistake**: Ran statistical analysis on simplified model without verifying it matches paper's full model.

**Correct Process**:
1. Implement full model (all terms)
2. Verify each term's effect independently
3. Check limiting cases (β → 0 should recover standard QEC)
4. Only then run full statistical analysis

**Rule**: Model validation is a prerequisite for statistical inference.

### 4. Sample Size Requirements Are Not Negotiable

**Mistake**: Accepted n=30 as "proof-of-concept" when paper requires N ~ 10^4-10^5.

**Correct Process**:
1. Acknowledge n=30 insufficient for conclusions
2. Use small n only for protocol debugging
3. Scale to required N before making claims
4. Report convergence tests (β stability vs N)

**Rule**: Statistical power requirements cannot be bypassed.

## Scientific Assessment (Final)

**Question**: Does this simulation validate LRT's entropy-error correlation prediction?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Why**:
1. Effect size discrepancy (β 100x-500x too large)
2. Sample size insufficient (n=30 << 10^4)
3. Model incomplete (missing γ(d), η log(p_phys) terms)

**What It Does Validate**:
- Protocol is implementable on Qiskit 2.x ✅
- Infrastructure works (entropy tracking, statistics, visualization) ✅
- Ready for model refinement and scaling ✅

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix model (implement full statistical model)
2. Investigate β discrepancy (expected: β drops to ~0.1-0.5)
3. Scale sample size (n → 10,000)
4. Then (and only then) re-assess validation claim
