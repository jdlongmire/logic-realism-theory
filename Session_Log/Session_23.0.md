1. Comprehensive paper review (~3,920 lines, 32 sections)
2. Structural framing per reviewer recommendations (Sections 1.4, 7.7, 32.2b + signposts)
3. Abstract revision for two-part structure clarity
4. Archive review and selective integration (L = P ∘ C, S = ℏC, Time from NC)
5. ISSUE 005 created for variational framework

**Master Paper Status**: 32 sections, ~4,100 lines (post-Session 22.0)

## Recommended Tasks (from Session 22.0)

1. **Figure integration** - Add conceptual figures (theory/figures/) with text flow
2. **C1-C3 clarifications** from reviewer:
   - C1: IIS vs 3FLL relationship
   - C2: Status of CBP (analytic, structural, methodological?)
   - C3: Modal status of 3FLL (ontological vs transcendental)
3. **ISSUE 005 path forward** - Variational framework derivation gaps
