# Session 1.0 - Repository Alignment to Foundational Paper

**Session Number**: 1.0
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Focus**: Align all active repository artifacts to foundational paper as north star
**Status**: ✅ **ALIGNMENT COMPLETE**

---

## Session Overview

**Critical Discovery**: The repository already contains a complete, publication-ready foundational paper (`theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`, 640 lines, ~30,000 words) that was not reflected in Session 0.0 documentation.

**Task**: Update all active artifacts (README, documentation, CLAUDE.md) to use the foundational paper as the canonical reference and north star for all development.

---

- Explicit derivations: Time (Stone), Energy (Spohn), Russell's paradox
- Primary testable prediction: β ≠ 0 in QEC (Section 5.3)
- Comparative analysis: LRT vs. MUH, pancomputationalism, structural realism (Section 7)
- 86 academic references

## Key Achievements

### 1. Discovered Repository More Advanced Than Documented

Session 0.0 indicated "in development" status for many components that were actually complete:
- Foundational paper: Complete (not stub)
- Lean axioms: 5 achieved, 0 sorry (not "in development")
- Theoretical framework: Fully formalized (not outline)

### 2. Established Foundational Paper as North Star

All active artifacts now reference `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` as the canonical source:
- README points to it
- All documentation files point to specific sections
- Development plans (Lean modules, notebooks) aligned to its structure

### 3. Updated Completion Status

**Previous claims** (Session 0.0):
- "Axiom Count: Target 5-7 (in development)"
- "Sorry Statements: Target 0 (in development)"
- "Foundational Paper: Outline/stub"

**Actual status** (verified):
- **Axiom Count: 5 (achieved)**
- **Sorry Statements: 0 (achieved)**
- **Foundational Paper: Complete (640 lines, peer-review ready)**

### 4. Aligned Development Roadmap

**Lean planned modules** now aligned to foundational paper:
- Operators/Projectors.lean → Section 3.3 (Π_id, {Π_i}, R)
- Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean → Section 3.4 (Stone's theorem)
- Derivations/Energy.lean → Section 3.4 (Spohn's inequality)
- Derivations/RussellParadox.lean → Section 3.4 (NC filtering)

**Notebook suite** aligned to foundational paper structure:
- 01: IIS and 3FLL → Section 2 (Premises)
- 02: Operator Formalism → Section 3.3
- 03-05: Derivations → Section 3.4
- 06-07: Quantum emergence → Superposition/measurement
- 08: Beta prediction → Section 5.3
- 09: Comparative analysis → Section 7

## Next Steps (For Session 1.1)

### Immediate Priority Options

**Option A - Continue Lean Development**:
1. Create `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Operators/Projectors.lean`
2. Define Π_id, {Π_i}, R as specified in foundational paper Section 3.3
3. Verify builds with 0 sorry

**Option B - Begin Notebook Development**:
1. Create `notebooks/01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb`
2. Implement necessity arguments from foundational paper Section 2.4
3. Follow professional notebook standards (CLAUDE.md)

**Option C - Expand Lean Derivations**:
1. Create `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean`
2. Formalize Stone's theorem application from foundational paper Section 3.4
3. Prove time emergence as theorem (not axiom)

### Session Management
1. Update Session 1.0 → Session 1.1 when major phase completes
2. Keep session log synchronized with work (progressive updates)
3. Commit and push after each major milestone

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Documentation Lag Can Obscure Progress

Session 0.0 documented "in development" status for components that were actually complete. This session corrected that by:
- Verifying actual state (grep, builds, file inspection)
- Updating all documentation to reflect reality
- Establishing clear completion criteria

### 2. North Star Prevents Fragmentation

Without a canonical reference, development fragments across:
- Multiple incomplete papers
- Inconsistent documentation
- Misaligned roadmaps

Establishing foundational paper as north star ensures:
- Single source of truth
- Consistent references
- Aligned development

### 3. Verification Before Claims

Session startup protocol now includes:
1. Read latest session log
2. **Run quick audit** (grep for sorry, verify build status)
3. Update understanding with verified facts
4. Continue with honest baseline

This prevents disconnect between claims and reality.

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Sessions

1. **Always verify completion status**: Don't rely on previous session logs alone; grep, build, inspect
2. **Use north star consistently**: Every artifact should reference canonical source (foundational paper)
3. **Update progressively**: Keep session logs current to prevent documentation lag
4. **Cross-reference systematically**: Docs ↔ paper sections, Lean ↔ paper formalization, notebooks ↔ paper derivations

### For Development Workflow

1. **Lean development**: Follow foundational paper Section 3.3-3.4 structure explicitly
2. **Notebook development**: Map to specific paper sections (01 → Section 2, 02 → Section 3.3, etc.)
3. **Documentation updates**: Always reference paper section numbers for traceability

---

**Session Status**: ✅ **ALIGNMENT COMPLETE**
**Next Session**: 1.1 - Begin development (Lean operators OR first notebook)
**Ready for**: Systematic development with clear north star guidance
