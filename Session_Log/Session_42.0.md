## Current Project Status

### Theory Status
- **Core thesis**: A = L(I) (Actuality = Logic applied to Infinite Information Space)
- **3FLL**: Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle)
- **Variational framework**: K_total = (ln 2)/β + 1/β² + 4β² (98% derived from first principles)

### Axiom Count (Tier System)
- **Tier 1 (LRT Specific)**: 2 axioms (I, I_infinite)
- **Tier 2 (Established Math Tools)**: ~16 axioms (Stone's, Gleason's, MaxEnt, etc.)
- **Tier 3 (Universal Physics)**: 1 axiom (energy additivity)
- **Total**: ~19 axioms

### Published Papers
- Logic Realism Theory: Technical Foundations (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17831883)
- IIS-LRT paper development (Issue 010)
- Scale Law paper

### Key Artifacts
- `Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md` - Complete theory paper (~2,456 lines)
- `theory/LRT_Internal_Assessment.md` - Honest state of the theory
- `lean/` - Formal Lean 4 verification (builds successfully)
- `theory/derivations/` - First-principles mathematical derivations (~3,700 lines)
- `blog-articles-commentary/` - Substack articles

## Work This Session

### Focus: LRT Evaluation and Main Paper Integration

User added `theory/2025-12-15-Claude-LRT-eval.md` - a transcript of Claude (web) evaluating LRT against critic challenges.

#### Critic's Three Challenges:
1. **No quantifiable predictions** distinguishing LRT from standard physics
2. **No actual connection to physics** - possible circularity in Tier-2 axioms
3. **Need verification without LLMs** - formal mathematical review required

#### Claude's Assessment:
- Scale Law paper substantially strengthens position
- 7 experimental platforms validate mechanism-dependent scaling exponents
- τ_BA ∝ s^(-β) with β determined by mechanism + noise correlation
- Diagnostic application: same GHZ state shows β=1 (SC qubits) vs β=2 (trapped ions)

#### Key Recommendations from Evaluation:
1. Add Section 6.2a "Boolean Actualization Scaling Law" to main paper
2. Update Section 1.5 "What This Paper Claims"
3. Modify Section 4.2 "Measurement Problem Dissolved"
4. Add rows to Table 1 in Section 5.9
5. Update Section 6 "Predictions and Falsifiers"
6. Add Falsifiers 13 (scaling exponent violations) and 14 (collapse saturation)
7. Modify Section 7.1 "What Remains Open"

#### Honest Scope Acknowledgments:
- Scale Law framework is operational physics (interpretation-neutral)
- LRT provides interpretive layer, doesn't generate predictions
- Tier-2 axioms (especially A3c local tomography) are physical inputs, not pure logic
- Physics comes from standard decoherence organized within LRT framework
