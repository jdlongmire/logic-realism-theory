## Session 27.0 Work

### 1. Em Dash Cleanup - COMPLETE

**Initial count:** 63 em dashes remaining
**Final count:** 0 em dashes

**Replacements made:**
- Sections 3-4: 6 replacements (completeness, A5, Hamiltonian, action principle, derivation chain, physical constraints)
- Section 4: 5 replacements (hidden variables, no-go theorem, IIS structure, correlations, Tsirelson limit)
- Section 5: 17 replacements (competitor list, measurement problem assessment, Born rule table, MWI comparison, layer structure table, parsimony comparison)
- Section 6: 10 replacements (structural requirement, GRW parameters, decoherence timing, foundational falsifiers, comparison tables)
- Section 7: 8 replacements (QFT core, constraint field implications, status table, wager quote, Wheeler quote)

**Replacement patterns used:**
- Colons for explanatory content (e.g., "is fundamental: physical reality emerges")
- Commas for parenthetical insertions (e.g., "discourse, including MWI's formulation")
- Semicolons for related clauses (e.g., "not adding ontology; it is recognizing")
- Parentheses for clarifying additions (e.g., "(rather than some other value)")
- N/A for table entries previously using em dashes
