## Context from Session 26.0

**Session 26.0 completed:**
- All review response revisions (10 items addressing high/medium severity issues)
- Archived paper integrations (Papers 2-4)
- Final review fixes (section numbering, figure paths, stakes paragraph)
- Editorial sweep (references, citations, consistency)
- Em dash replacement: 48% complete (~57 of ~120)

**Remaining from Session 26.0:**
- Em dash replacement in Sections 5-7 (~63 remaining)

## Session 27.0 Work

### 1. Em Dash Cleanup - COMPLETE

**Initial count:** 63 em dashes remaining
**Final count:** 0 em dashes

**Replacements made:**
- Sections 3-4: 6 replacements (completeness, A5, Hamiltonian, action principle, derivation chain, physical constraints)
- Section 4: 5 replacements (hidden variables, no-go theorem, IIS structure, correlations, Tsirelson limit)
- Section 5: 17 replacements (competitor list, measurement problem assessment, Born rule table, MWI comparison, layer structure table, parsimony comparison)
- Section 6: 10 replacements (structural requirement, GRW parameters, decoherence timing, foundational falsifiers, comparison tables)
- Section 7: 8 replacements (QFT core, constraint field implications, status table, wager quote, Wheeler quote)

**Replacement patterns used:**
- Colons for explanatory content (e.g., "is fundamental: physical reality emerges")
- Commas for parenthetical insertions (e.g., "discourse, including MWI's formulation")
- Semicolons for related clauses (e.g., "not adding ontology; it is recognizing")
- Parentheses for clarifying additions (e.g., "(rather than some other value)")
- N/A for table entries previously using em dashes

- All em dashes replaced with appropriate punctuation
- All review issues addressed
- All archived paper content integrated
- References complete
- Figures verified

## Session 27.0 Additional Work

### 2. Reviewer Defense Preparation

Created `review_response/DEFENSE_FRAMEWORK.md` containing:

**Core claims identified (7):**
1. 3FLL are ontological, not cognitive
2. IIS is coherent and well-defined
3. QM is the unique stable interface
4. Born rule, Hilbert space, unitarity are derived
5. 17 phenomena unified
6. Complex QM confirmed as prediction
7. LRT adds no new ontology

**Objections anticipated (13 across 4 categories):**
- Category A (Foundational): Circularity, logic-to-physics gap, parsimony, ontological status
- Category B (Technical): IIS definition, reconstruction theorem usage, local tomography, measurement problem
- Category C (Comparative): Prediction credit, shared falsifiers, anthropic reasoning, Bell correlations
- Category D (Scope): QFT extension, outcome selection

**Defense priorities established:**
- Non-negotiable: Core thesis, derivation structure
- Defensible: Explanatory claims
- Revisable: Specific formulations
- Acknowledgeable: Scope limitations

**Red lines identified:** 5 conditions that would require fundamental revision (none currently evidenced)

### 3. Red Team Response

Created `review_response/RED_TEAM_RESPONSE.md` addressing 5 attack vectors:

| Attack | Severity | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Local Tomography "Trojan Horse" | HIGH | Partially concede, reframe as minimal physical input |
| Relativity Simultaneity Gap | MEDIUM-HIGH | Acknowledge as open, not fatal |
| Interface "Magic Line" | MEDIUM | Acknowledge as open, defend as progress |
| Black Hole Information Gamble | MEDIUM-HIGH | Accept the bet, note favorable evidence |
| Non-Contextuality Grounding | MEDIUM | Defend the distinction between outcome/measure contextuality |

**Key insight:** The critic's charitable summary is fair but incomplete. LRT never claimed pure logical derivation. The physical axioms are minimal and grounded. Open problems generate a research program, not interpretive impasse.

### 4. Referee Report Response

**Verdict received:** Accept with Revisions (Grade A-)

**Required revisions implemented:**

| # | Revision | Location | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Reframe "derivation" claims re: local tomography | Abstract, Section 1.5 | DONE |
| 2 | Categorize relativistic interface as core open problem | Section 7.1 (new subsection) | DONE |
| 3 | Highlight information loss as direct falsifier | Section 6.3 (new subsection) | DONE |

**Response letter created:** `review_response/REFEREE_RESPONSE.md`
