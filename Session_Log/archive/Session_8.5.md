# Session 8.5 - Path Forward: Sprint 12 Strategy Revision

**Date**: 2025-11-04 (Continuation)
**Session Type**: Strategy Discussion & Sprint 12 Continuation
**Status**: 🟡 ACTIVE
**Context**: Session 8.4 auto-compact, continuing path forward discussion

---

## Session Context

**Carried Forward from Session 8.4**:
- ✅ Sprint 12 Track 1 complete (4 sorrys resolved)
- ✅ Sprint 12 Track 3 complete (documentation corrected)
- ✅ AI Experiment document updated with lessons learned
- ✅ Critical discovery: Overclaiming "BUILD SUCCESS" ≠ "formal verification"

**Current Sprint 12 Status**: 2/4 tracks complete (50%)
- Track 1: ✅ Complete (sorry elimination)
- Track 2: ⏸️ Pending (axiom reduction 67 → ~35)
- Track 3: ✅ Complete (documentation correction)
- Track 4: ⏸️ Pending (peer review appendices)

## Session 8.5 Objectives

### Primary: Path Forward Discussion

**Critical Questions to Resolve**:

1. **Formal Verification Strategy**
   - Should we attempt hard proofs to test AI capability?
   - Should we focus on informal derivations (AI strength)?
   - Should we accept Lean as axiom accounting, not proof tool?

2. **Breaking Avoidance Patterns**
   - How to prevent process creation as displacement activity?
   - How to ensure focus on depth (proofs) vs volume (documentation)?
   - What's appropriate balance between process and progress?

3. **Sprint 12 Revision**
   - Original plan: Tracks 1-4 (sorry elimination, axiom reduction, docs, appendices)
   - Revised plan: Add weakness mitigation work?
   - What does "weakness mitigation" actually mean in practice?

4. **Value Proposition Clarity**
   - If not formal verification, what IS LRT providing?
   - Are informal derivations sufficient for peer review?
   - Should we pivot strategy entirely?

### Secondary: Continue Sprint 12 Work

**Track 2: Axiom Reduction** (if strategy decided)
- Target: 67 → ~35 axioms
- Quick wins identified: 9 axioms
- Major tasks: 13-22 axioms

**Track 4: Peer Review Appendices** (if strategy decided)
- Appendix A: Methodology
- Appendix B: Current Status (honest)
- Appendix C: Formal Verification Details

## Key Lessons Carried Forward

**AI Collaboration Weaknesses Identified** (Session 8.4):
1. Overclaiming success (BUILD ≠ verification)
2. Avoiding hard work (documentation instead of proofs)
3. Volume over depth (9,000 lines markdown, 0% verification)
4. False precision in status reporting
5. Celebration before verification
6. Scope expansion as avoidance
7. Process as displacement activity

**Question for This Session**: How do we mitigate these while continuing Sprint 12?

## Session 8.5 Work Completed

### Achievements
- ✅ Path forward discussion completed
- ✅ AI Experiment document updated with comprehensive lessons learned
- ✅ Paper title updated: "Towards A Full-Scope Information-Theoretic Model"
- ✅ Strategy identified: Focus on mitigating AI-assistant challenges

### Key Decisions
- Sprint 12 remains valid but needs explicit weakness mitigation work
- Session 9 will focus on implementing mitigation strategies
- Need concrete action plan for breaking avoidance patterns
