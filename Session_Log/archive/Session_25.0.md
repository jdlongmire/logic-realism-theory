**Focus**: TBD
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Context from Session 24.0

**Session 24.0**: Minimal activity - session started, awaiting direction.

**Carried Over:**
- ISSUE 005: Variational Framework (OPEN)
- ISSUE 006: Bit as Fundamental (OPEN)
- C1-C3 clarifications from reviewer pending

---

## File Reorganization (Pre-Session)

User reorganized theory artifacts before this session:

1. **Renamed**: `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory_Master.md` → `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md`
2. **New Title**: "It from Bit, Bit from Fit: Foundational Physics Logically Remastered"
3. **Archived**: Old versions moved to `theory/archive/`
   - `Logic_Realism_Theory_Master-v3-DEPRACATED.md`
   - `Logic_Realism_Theory_Master_BACKUP_20251127v2.md`

**Paper Status**: ~4,150 lines, 32 sections, publication-ready

## Session 25.0 Work

### Systematic Document Review

Completed section-by-section review of `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md` (~1,160 lines, 7 sections).

**Major Strengths Identified:**
- Novel explanatory framework (grounding vs. postulating QM axioms)
- Legitimate derivation chain via established theorems
- 12 explicit falsifiers (good scientific practice)
- Confirmed prediction (complex QM, Renou 2021)
- Epistemic honesty about limitations
- Clear writing and organization

**Major Issues Identified:**

| Issue | Section | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Global Parsimony underargued | 2.6 | High |
| Non-contextuality grounding (A5) contestable | 3.1 | High |
| Measurement problem dissolution incomplete | 4.2 | High |
| IIS characterization imprecise | 2.2 | Medium |
| D → [0,1] mapping not justified | 3.3 | Medium |
| "17 phenomena explained" overclaims | 4.1 | Medium |
| Tsirelson bound explanation weak | 4.4 | Medium |
| Most falsifiers in-principle or shared | 6.3 | Medium |

**Recommendations:**
1. Strengthen Global Parsimony argument (foundational)
2. Clarify A5 grounding with more defense
3. Reduce or recategorize "17 phenomena" claim
4. Clarify IIS mathematical status
5. Add bridging lemmas in Section 3
6. Tone down Section 5 advocacy
7. Fix figure paths (lines 289, 528)

**Circularity Check:** No circularity detected. Derivation chain is linear.

**Bottom Line:** Publishable in foundations journal. Core contribution is novel. Execution has vulnerabilities a hostile reviewer would exploit.

### Document Cleanup

After review, made the following edits to `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md`:

1. **Fixed figure paths** - Updated to relative paths (`figures/LRT_Fig-1.jpeg`, `figures/LRT_Fig2b.png`)
2. **Removed duplicate derivation chain** - Section 3.7 ASCII diagram removed, kept Figure 2
3. **Moved Figure 2** - Now directly under Section 3.7 heading
4. **Replaced Figure 2 image** - Using `LRT_Fig2b.png` (Mermaid didn't render properly)
5. **Removed editorial placeholders** - 5 "[Section X — to follow]" notes removed

**Git commits this session:** 9 commits, all pushed to master.

## Session Status

**Status**: PAUSED

**Next steps when resuming:**
- Address high-severity issues from review (Global Parsimony, A5 grounding, measurement dissolution)
- Consider reducing "17 phenomena" claim
- ISSUE 005 and 006 still open
