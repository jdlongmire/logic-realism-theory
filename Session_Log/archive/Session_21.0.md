## Session 21.0 Accomplishments

### 1. Section 32: Conclusion
Added final conclusion section with 5 subsections covering central claim, achievements, limitations, status, and closing.

### 2. ISSUE 004: Editorial Remediation

**Phase 1 (Critical) - COMPLETE:**
- Fixed Part IV header: `#` → `##`
- Renumbered Section 19 theorems: 18.1→19.1, 18.3→19.2, 18.5→19.3, 18.6→19.4
- Renumbered Lemma 18.2 → 19.6, Definition 18.4 → 19.5
- Updated cross-references

**Phase 2 (Moderate) - COMPLETE:**
- Renumbered Section 22 items: 21.x → 22.x
- Added clarifying note for Axiom 3(b) derived status

**Phase 3 (Polish) - COMPLETE:**
- Drafted hybrid abstract emphasizing Global Constraint Satisfaction and falsifiability
- Polished with Grok review feedback
- Integrated final abstract into Master Paper

### 3. New Abstract

Integrated polished abstract emphasizing:
- Global Constraint Satisfaction (reframing non-locality)
- Global Parsimony as falsifiability anchor
- Honest epistemic framing ("selected" not "derived")
- Explicit testable predictions and 12 falsifiers

### 4. Repository Reorganization
- Moved original papers to `theory/archive/`
- Updated README.md with new paths
- Updated repository structure documentation

### 5. Final Verification Fix
- Fixed Section 1.3: "six parts" → "four parts followed by a concluding synthesis"
- Removed reference to non-existent Appendix A

### 6. Editorial Review Discussion

Received 7-point editorial recommendation (external LLM review). After critical analysis:

**ACCEPTED (for next session):**
- Signposting paragraphs at end of Parts I-IV (high value, no risk)
- Possibly: "What LRT Does/Does Not Claim" bullet list in Section 1
- Consider: Softened reframe for Sections 10 and 20 openings

**REJECTED (overclaiming risk):**
- Wholesale Section 1 replacement (current version is strong)
- New abstract (already polished, new version overclaims)
- Section 1.7 "What Is At Stake" (claims achievements not demonstrated)
- Strengthened conclusion (invites reviewer hostility)
- Title change ("Logic Realism Theory" is accurate)

---

## ISSUE 004 Status

**CLOSED** - All phases complete, all verification issues resolved.

---

## Final Paper Statistics

- **Total Sections**: 32
- **Total Lines**: ~3,900
- **Structure**: 4 Parts + Conclusion
- **Falsifiers**: 12 explicit
- **Predictions**: Multiple (including confirmed Renou et al. 2021)

---

## Next Session (22.0) Setup

### Priority Tasks

1. **Signposting Paragraphs** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Add short bridging paragraphs at end of Parts I, II, III, IV
   - Format: "Part X established... Part Y will now..."
   - Purely navigational, no new claims
   - ~4 paragraphs total

2. **Optional Enhancements** (LOWER PRIORITY)
   - Consider adding "What LRT Does/Does Not Claim" bullet list to Section 1.5
   - Consider softened openings for Sections 10 and 20

### Do NOT Do
- Wholesale Section 1 replacement
- Abstract changes
- Title changes
- Section 1.7 additions
- Conclusion strengthening

### Reference
The editorial discussion is captured in this session log. The key insight: **clarity improvements yes, ambition inflation no**.

## Session Closed

Session 21.0 complete. The LRT Master Paper is publication-ready.

Next session: Optional polish (signposting) if desired.
