# Session 17.0

**Date**: 2025-11-26
**Focus**: Continue Master Paper Synthesis
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## Context from Session 16.0

**Previous Session Achievements**:
1. Created `Logic_Realism_Theory_Master.md` - synthesized paper
2. Drafted 5/41 sections (~3,450 words):
   - Abstract, Introduction, 3FLL, Central Argument (IBE), IIS, Boolean Actuality
3. Incorporated ChatGPT review feedback for Sections 1-5
4. Established key architectural decisions:
   - Two co-primitives (3FLL + IIS) as minimal ontological base
   - Parsimony is DERIVED (Part III), not assumed
   - IIS vs Actuality distinction clarified

**Next Steps from Session 16.0**:
1. Section 6: Objections and Responses
2. Complete Part I (philosophical foundations)
3. Begin Part II (physical interpretation)

---

## Session 17.0 Goals

1. Complete Part I (Section 6: Objections and Responses)
2. Begin Part II (Physical Interpretation)

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Section 6: Objections and Responses (RECOVERED)

Session was interrupted but Section 6 was already drafted with ChatGPT feedback incorporated:

| Objection | Topic | Key Response |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| 6.1 | Unfalsifiability | Framework claim + transcendental falsifiers |
| 6.2 | Category Error | Structure not syntax; reality instantiates logic |
| 6.3 | Kantian Alternative | Math effectiveness, surprise, causal intervention |
| 6.4 | Epistemic Gap | Transcendental-ontological, not inductive |
| 6.5 | Quantum Mechanics | Indeterminacy ≠ contradiction; IIS/A distinction |
| 6.6 | Dialetheism | No dialetheic physics exists |

**ChatGPT Feedback Incorporated**:
- §6.1: "without collapsing predictive capacity" + "inferential collapse"
- §6.2: Clarified instantiation language
- §6.3: "unexplained" not "miraculous"; parsimony simplified
- §6.4: "classical laws" not "classical physics"
- §6.5: IIS/A mapping; interpretation-independent outcomes
- §6.6: Semantic vs empirical domains; final tie-back

**Word count**: ~1,600 words
**Part I Status**: COMPLETE (6/6 sections)
