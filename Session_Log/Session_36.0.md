# Session 36.0 - New Session

**Date**: 2025-12-02
**Focus**: TBD (awaiting user direction)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## Session Context

**Previous Session**: Session 35.0 (2025-12-01)
- Developed QFT/Gravity Extension paper (756 lines, complete)
- Implemented Gemini/Grok philosophical refinements
- Reserved Zenodo DOIs for all 4 papers
- Added cross-references between all papers

## Project Status Summary

### Core Thesis
**A = P(C(I))**: Actuality = Parsimony(Constitution(Infinite Information Space))

The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) are ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality, not merely rules of reasoning.

### Immediate Next Steps (from Session 35.0)
- [ ] Convert markdown → PDF (requires LaTeX: `winget install MiKTeX.MiKTeX`)
- [ ] Upload PDFs to Zenodo drafts
- [ ] Publish Phase 1 (Main, Technical, Philosophy)
- [ ] Publish Phase 2 (QFT Extension)

### Open Issues
| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 003 - Lean 4 Formalization | PLANNED |
| 005 - Variational Framework | OPEN |
| 006 - Bit as Fundamental | OPEN |

## Work Completed

### 1. Comprehensive All-Work Survey

Surveyed ~392 files across 5 major folders to identify overlooked nuggets and ideas:

**Folders Surveyed**:
- theory/ (121 files): Archive, derivations, frameworks, predictions, issues, drafts
- lean/ (28 files): All Lean formalization work
- notebooks/ (31 files): Computational validation notebooks
- approach_2_reference/ (202 files): Earlier framework with transferable proofs
- archive/ (10 files): Root archive folder

**Key Findings**:

| Category | Nuggets Found | Action Items |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| theory/ | 12 | 8 |
| lean/ | 5 | 6 |
| notebooks/ | 4 | 4 |
| approach_2_reference/ | 4 | 3 |
| archive/ | 6 | 3 |
| **Total** | **31** | **24** |

**High-Priority Resurrection Candidates**:

1. **COMPUTATIONAL_VALIDATION_SPRINT.md** - Incorrectly archived, should be active sprint
2. **LRT_Current_Comparison_Scorecard.md** - Living strategy document, incorrectly archived
3. **Phase 4 Measurement Mechanism** - Critical derivation gap affecting predictions
4. **TimeEmergence.lean fix** - 1 sorry, fixable in 30 min via axiom refactor
5. **Measurement Structure from approach_2** - 302 lines of 0-sorry formalization

**Critical Technical Gaps Identified**:

- Lean: 55 sorry statements, ~15% proofs complete
- Phase 4 stabilization mechanism: UNKNOWN (critical)
- Equal phase weighting: ~30% derived
- Local tomography: Cannot derive (accept as axiom)

**Deliverable**: `theory/all-work-survey.md` (comprehensive findings document)

### 2. Created ISSUE 007

Formalized survey findings as trackable issue: `theory/issues/ISSUE_007_All_Work_Survey_Findings.md`

**Issue Contents**:
- 6 critical findings documented
- Action items organized by priority (Immediate/Short-Term/Medium-Term)
- Research questions identified
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Links to related issues (003, 005, 006)
