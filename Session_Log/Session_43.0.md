## Session Objective

**Gap 1A**: Derive the collapse rate from 3FLL + Global Parsimony

### Why This Gap:
- Concrete experimental target (levitated nanoparticles)
- Clear distinction from standard GRW (free parameter vs. derived)
- Testable within 5-10 years
- If successful, would be major physics result

### Approach:
1. Start with Penrose-Diósi formula: λ ~ Gm²/rℏc
2. Show why this specific formula follows from Global Parsimony
3. Derive exact coefficient (not just dimensional analysis)
4. Predict specific value testable in experiments

## Background: Current LRT Position on Collapse

### From Main Paper:
- Global Parsimony: "Any collapse parameter not derivable from geometry or information capacity would constitute surplus structure"
- Falsifier 12: Collapse with underivable free parameters

### From QFT-Gravity Extension:
- Conjecture 6.2: τ_collapse ~ ℏR/(Gm²)
- Critical caveat: "This is the Penrose-Diósi model, not an LRT derivation"

### The Gap:
- LRT claims parameters must be derivable
- But does NOT derive the formula from 3FLL + Global Parsimony
- Does NOT show why THIS formula specifically

## Work This Session

### Created: `theory/LRT_Prediction_Collapse.md`

Comprehensive document (~400 lines) covering:

1. **Objective**: Derive collapse rate from LRT first principles
2. **Current LRT Position**: What's claimed vs. what's proven
3. **Penrose-Diósi Formula**: Standard derivation and numerical estimates
4. **Derivation Strategy**:
   - Global Parsimony constraints
   - Available quantities (m, R, G, ℏ, c)
   - Dimensional analysis
5. **Argument from Global Parsimony**:
   - Why gravitational self-energy is unique
   - Why energy-time uncertainty applies
   - The coefficient question
6. **LRT-Specific Predictions**:
   - λ ∝ m² (vs GRW's λ ∝ m)
   - λ ∝ 1/R (vs GRW's size-independence)
   - Falsification conditions
7. **Experimental Roadmap**: 5-10 year horizon
8. **Honest Assessment**: What LRT provides vs. what it doesn't

### Key Finding

**The honest claim:**
> LRT's Global Parsimony constrains collapse mechanisms to have geometry-derivable parameters. The Penrose-Diósi formula τ ~ ℏR/(Gm²) satisfies this constraint and is therefore the LRT-compatible collapse model.

**What LRT provides:**
- Principled reason to prefer Penrose-Diósi over GRW (derivability)
- Specific testable predictions (m² scaling, size dependence)

**What LRT does NOT provide:**
- Pure derivation from 3FLL without physics input
- Proof that gravity is the unique collapse mechanism

### Discriminating Test

Measure collapse rate as function of mass at fixed R:
- LRT (Penrose-Diósi): λ ∝ m²
- GRW: λ ∝ m

Factor of 10 in mass gives 100× (LRT) vs 10× (GRW) rate change.
