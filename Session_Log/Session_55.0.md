# Session 55.0

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Focus**: Restore and revise Zenodo papers with current LRT framework
**Status**: CLOSED

---

## Context

Continuing from Session 54.0, which completed the Identity Continuity Integration across all 5 LRT papers:
- Position Paper: Added §2.3 (Qualitative/Quantitative Identity)
- QFT Statistics Paper: Added §2.3 linking to permutation symmetry
- GR Extension: Added §6 (Identity Strain), §8.4 (Meta-Proof Summary), §9 (6 new Objections)
- Born Rule & Hilbert Space: Updated companion paper listings

Current state:
- Minor uncommitted changes in `.claude/settings.local.json` and `theory/_quarto.yml`
- All papers updated and PDFs regenerated as of Session 54

## Progress

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Session initialization | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Restore 3 Zenodo papers from archive to theory/ | ✅ Complete |

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored 3 papers from archive (per Zenodo DOIs)

| Zenodo DOI | Title | New Location |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 17831819 | It from Bit, Bit from Fit | `theory/20251205_It_From_Bit_Bit_From_Fit.md` |
| 17831912 | Philosophical Foundations | `theory/20251205_Logic_Realism_Theory_Philosophical_Foundations.md` |
| 17831883 | Technical Foundations | `theory/20251216_Logic_Realism_Theory_Technical_Foundations.md` |

### 2. Added pointer updates to Philosophical Foundations & Technical Foundations

- Added framework evolution note (January 2026)
- Added link to LRT Zenodo Community
- Updated companion paper references to current 5-paper suite

### 3. Comprehensive revision of "It From Bit, Bit From Fit" paper

**Full integration with current framework:**

- **Title**: Updated to "Foundational Physics Logically Remastered"
- **Abstract**: Updated with $I_\infty$/$A_\Omega$ terminology, vehicle-weight invariance, local tomography
- **§1 Introduction**: Completely rewritten with 5-paper suite structure, derivational claims
- **§2 Two Domains**: Updated terminology (IIS→$I_\infty$, 3FLL→$L_3$), added §2.3 Qualitative/Quantitative Identity with Bounded Distinguishability Lemma
- **§3 Distinguishability**: Emphasized Determinate Identity as primary, added distinguishability metric
- **§6 Born Rule**: Added vehicle-weight invariance derivation (§6.2), complex Hilbert space derivation (§6.3), derivational structure table (§6.4)
- **§7.6 Identical Particles**: Added permutation symmetry derivation from Id
- **§12 Honest Accounting**: Restructured to Tier 1/2/3 derivation levels
- **§13 Conclusion**: Updated to reflect derivational (not fine-tuning) stance
- **References**: Added full 5-paper suite with Zenodo community link
- **Terminology**: Replaced IIS→$I_\infty$, 3FLL→$L_3$, Boolean actuality→$A_\Omega$ throughout
