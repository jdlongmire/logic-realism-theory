## Current Status Summary (End of Session 3.12)

### Sprint 5 Progress: 8/13 Deliverables Complete (62%)

**COMPLETED**:
1. ✅ `theory/Energy_Circularity_Analysis.md` - Analysis document
2. ✅ `theory/Eta_Parameter_Analysis.md` - Analysis document
3. ✅ `scripts/energy_noether_derivation.py` - Energy from Noether's theorem

2. ⏳ Revised Section 2.3.1 (Pre-mathematical formulation - Track 3)
3. ⏳ Revised Section 5.1.2 (η first-principles integration - Track 2) **← HIGHEST PRIORITY**
4. ⏳ Revised Section 9.1 (Lean language precision - Track 4)
5. ⏳ Sprint 5 final multi-LLM review (quality ≥ 0.80)

### Sprint 4 Status: Awaiting Track 2 Integration

**Multi-LLM Review Results** (Session 3.12):
- Overall Quality Score: 0.728 / 0.80 (FAIL)
- Grok: 0.81 (Go with critical issues)
- Gemini: 0.77 (No-Go recommendation)
- ChatGPT: 0.605 (Low actionability)

**Critical Blocker Identified** (ALL THREE models unanimous):
- Section 5.1.2: η parameter is phenomenological (not derived from A = L(I))
- Current: η ∈ [0.11, 0.43] fitted to match target T2/T1 ∈ [0.7, 0.9]
- Problem: Circular reasoning (fit → "predict")

**Resolution** (Sprint 5 Track 2 - COMPLETE):
- ✅ Non-circular η derivation from Fisher information geometry
- ✅ Starting points: A = L(I), V_K geometry, Shannon entropy
- ✅ J(K_ground = 0.1) = 3624.19, J(K_superposition = 1.0) = 36.00
- ✅ Derived η = 0.0098 (entropy-weighted) or 0.9902 (Fisher-only)
- ✅ Target [0.11, 0.43]: NOT matched (but this is scientifically honest)

**Expected Impact After Integration**:
- Section 5.1.2 score: 0.83 → 0.90-0.95
- Overall paper score: 0.728 → 0.75-0.80 (near/at threshold)
- T2/T1 prediction becomes genuinely falsifiable (not circular)

### Path 3 Protocol Status: Deferred

**Multi-LLM Review Results** (Session 3.12):
- Quality Score: 0.622 / 0.70 (FAIL)
- Grok: 0.65 (No-Go)
- Gemini: 0.62 (No-Go)
- ChatGPT: 0.595 (Generic response)

**Critical Issues**:
1. T1 and T2 definitions need clarification
2. Statistical power analysis missing
3. Error mitigation strategies insufficient
4. Resource commitment (~120 hours) not justified
5. Preliminary simulations lacking

**Decision**: DEFER to future sprint (after Sprint 5 complete)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours substantial revision

### Lean Build Status

**Last Check** (Session 3.9): 3 sorry statements remaining
- All in `TimeEmergence.lean` (lines 178, 277)
- Background process running (may have updates)

---

## Priority Task List for Session 4.0+

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - Sprint 5 Critical Path

**Priority 1: Integrate Track 2 η Derivation into Paper Section 5.1.2** (2-3 hours)

**Why Critical**:
- Sprint 4 failed (0.728/0.80) specifically due to phenomenological η
- ALL THREE multi-LLM models identified this as critical issue
- Track 2 Approach 3 derivation directly addresses this
- Expected improvement: Section 5.1.2 score 0.83 → 0.90-0.95
- Expected impact: Overall score 0.728 → 0.75-0.80 (near/at threshold)

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 5.1.2, starting line ~680)

**Content to Add**:
1. Replace phenomenological η approach with Fisher information derivation
2. Document derivation: η = (J_superposition / J_ground) × (ΔS_EM / ln 2)
3. Present derived values: η = 0.0098 (entropy-weighted) or 0.9902 (Fisher-only)
4. Acknowledge mismatch with target [0.11, 0.43]
5. Frame as testable prediction: η ∈ [0.11, 0.43] requires J_ratio ∈ [0.20, 0.70]
6. Reference: `scripts/eta_information_derivation.py`
7. Explain scientific reasoning: Mismatch = genuine prediction, not circular fit

**Approach**:
- Keep existing Shannon entropy calculation (ΔS_EM = ln(2))
- Replace phenomenological η section with information-theoretic derivation
- Add Fisher information geometry subsection
- Maintain QuTiP validation (protocol feasibility, not prediction)
- Update conclusion to emphasize first-principles nature

**Deliverables**:
- Revised Section 5.1.2 (~1,500-2,000 words total)
- Cross-references to Track 2 derivation files
- Updated paper commit

---

**Priority 2: Multi-LLM Review of Revised Section 5.1.2** (1 hour)

**Why Critical**:
- Validate that first-principles η addresses phenomenology critique
- Confirm quality score improvement to ≥ 0.90 for this section
- Determine if overall paper quality reaches ≥ 0.80 threshold

**Process**:
1. Extract revised Section 5.1.2 text
2. Prepare focused review query for multi-LLM team
3. Run consultation via `enhanced_llm_bridge.py`
4. Target: Section quality ≥ 0.90, team consensus "Accept"

**Success Criteria**:
- Section 5.1.2 score ≥ 0.90
- η derivation rigor confirmed by all 3 models
- No critical issues identified
- Team recommends proceeding with paper resubmission

---

**Priority 3: Track 3 - Revise Section 2.3.1 (Pre-Mathematical Formulation)** (1-2 hours)

**Why Important**:
- Current score: 0.81 (barely acceptable, weakest section philosophically)
- Multi-LLM critiques: weak gravity analogy, L undefined, missing philosophical grounding

**Proposed Revisions**:
1. **Replace gravity analogy** with wave-particle duality (domain-specific, familiar to physicists)
2. **Define L's properties** explicitly:
   - Filtering: L selects consistent configurations
   - Universal: Applies to all information
   - Pre-formal: Independent of mathematical representation
   - Structural: Imposes geometric constraints
3. **Add ontic structural realism framework** (Ladyman & Ross citations)
4. **Link to predictions**: L → V_K geometry → Fisher information → η → T2/T1

**Expected Impact**:
- Section 2.3.1 score: 0.81 → 0.87-0.90
- Overall paper score improvement: +0.01 to +0.02

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 2.3.1)

---

**Priority 4: Track 4 - Correct Section 9.1 Claims (Lean Language Precision)** (30 minutes)

**Why Important**:
- Multi-LLM review gave this section high marks (0.86 average)
- But still needs minor corrections per peer review Issue #4
- Quick fixes, high impact on integrity

**Actions**:
1. Review current Section 9.1 text
2. Ensure claims about "0 axioms" are precise
3. Verify distinction between mathematical vs physical axiomatization is clear
4. Add example Lean code snippet if helpful (Grok suggested this)

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 9.1)

---

**Priority 5: Address Other Sprint 4 Minor Issues** (1.5 hours)

**Section 3.4.1 (Non-Unitary Evolution)** - Score: 0.81
- Issue: K physical meaning unclear
- Fix: Add subsection explaining K determination
- Fix: Describe K → K-ΔK transition mechanism
- Estimated time: 1 hour

**Section 5.1.1 (Confound Isolation)** - Score: 0.86
- Issue: Confidence levels (60%, 80%, 95%) not justified
- Fix: Add paragraph with statistical basis
- Estimated time: 30 minutes

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Sprint 5 Documentation
