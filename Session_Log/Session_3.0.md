# Session 3.0 - Hilbert Space Formalization and Sorry Elimination

**Session Number**: 3.0
**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Focus**: Lean Proof Completion (Hilbert Space Integration)
**Previous Session**: Session 2.12 (Energy.lean Completion and TimeEmergence.lean Compilation Fix)

---

## Session Overview

**Primary Objective**: Complete Hilbert space formalization to resolve 3 remaining sorry statements in TimeEmergence.lean.

**User Directive**: Option A - Complete Hilbert Space Formalization

**Starting State**:
- ✅ Energy.lean: 0 sorry, builds successfully
- ⚠️ TimeEmergence.lean: 3 sorry (lines 178 x2, 277), builds successfully
- ✅ RussellParadox.lean: 0 sorry
- ✅ Actualization.lean: 0 sorry
- **Total**: 3 sorry statements in entire codebase

**Goal State**: 0 sorry statements across entire codebase

## Phase 1: Session Setup

### Audit Results (Session Start)

**Verified Sorry Count**:
```
LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean:184:    sorry
LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean:190:    sorry
LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean:287:    sorry
```

**Build Status**: ✅ All modules build successfully
- Energy.lean: Completed in Session 2.12
- TimeEmergence.lean: Compiles with 3 documented sorry statements

**Reference Material**: `approach_2_reference/lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/QuantumEmergence/HilbertSpace.lean`
- 674 lines with comprehensive axiomatization
- ProjectionOperator, UnitaryOperator, SelfAdjointOperator structures
- Scholarly justifications (Halmos, Reed & Simon, Kadison & Ringrose)

## Next Steps

**Immediate**:
1. Examine reference HilbertSpace.lean structure
2. Adapt to Lean 4 syntax with proper type class handling
3. Update TimeEmergence.lean imports and structures
4. Resolve 3 sorry statements
5. Verify build and commit
