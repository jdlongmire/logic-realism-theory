## Previous Session Summary (47.0)

Session 47.0 was a placeholder session awaiting direction. Key context from Session 46.0:

### IJQF Submission Complete
- Philosophy paper fully revised responding to formal referee report
- Core thesis formalized: 𝔄 = 𝔏(𝔍) decomposed into Theorem 1 + Conjecture 1
- Referee-hardened with red team defenses (parsimony, intuitionist, QBist critiques)
- Submission package: `theory/submissions/IJQF/LRT_IJQF_Submission.pdf`

### New Development
- **Untracked file**: `theory/20251221-Claude-LRT-ground-up.md` (~485KB)
  - Transcript of extensive Claude conversation exploring LRT from first principles
  - Fresh evaluation of the logical constraint principle
  - Discussion of ontological architecture (infinite information space + 3FLL constraint)
  - Addresses circularity concerns, scope questions, Kantian objections
  - Valuable independent assessment of theory's logical structure

## Current Project State

### LRT Axiom Structure
- **Tier 1** (LRT Specific): 2 axioms (I, I_infinite)
- **Tier 2** (Established Math Tools): ~16 axioms
- **Tier 3** (Universal Physics): 1 axiom
- **Total**: ~19 axioms

### Key Deliverables

| `theory/2025-12-17_LRT_Formal_Core.md` | Tightest formal framing |
| `theory/submissions/IJQF/` | Complete submission package |

### Open Issues

## Session 48.0 Work

### Program Revamp Analysis

User considering revamping the program using two new files as baseline:
- `theory/20251221-logic_realism_theory.md` - New paper draft with cleaner structure
- `theory/20251221-Claude-LRT-ground-up.md` (~485KB) - Fresh Claude conversation exploring LRT from first principles

**User Intent**: Selective merge - incorporate best elements into existing structure
**Motivation**: Fresh start + clearer presentation

### Best Elements Identified

**From new paper (`20251221-logic_realism_theory.md`):**
| Element | Value | Current Equivalent |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **I∞, L₃, A*** notation | Self-documenting, avoids Unicode issues | 𝔍, 𝔏, 𝔄 (less intuitive) |
| **Primitive Criteria** (§1.2) | Explicit 5-point test for what counts as primitive | Implicit |
| **Purity Test** | 4 questions to verify primitives | Not formalized |
| **Meta-Principles MP1-MP4** | Axiomatic freedom, pure entanglement, pure superposition, ontological parsimony | Scattered |
| **Gödel Pre-Arithmetic Argument** (§2.4) | Clear rebuttal to "Gödel objection" | Defensive only |
| **Derivation Structure** (§4) | Step-by-step proofs with candidate alternatives ruled out | Less systematic |

**From ground-up conversation (`20251221-Claude-LRT-ground-up.md`):**
| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Type 1/Type 2 Distinction** | Vehicle vs content for conceiving contradictions - addresses key objection |
| **Co-Fundamentality Analysis** | Why 2 primitives, not 1 or 3 |
| **Circularity Analysis** | Fresh verification that framework isn't circular |
| **Comparison Table** | LRT vs Physicalism vs Tegmark - useful for papers |
| **Necessity Operator Analysis** | □∃I, □∃L, □(P = L(I)) - formal precision |

### Proposed Merge Options (For Future Session)

| Option | Description | Effort |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **A: Notation Only** | Adopt I∞, L₃, A* across materials | ~2-3 hours |
| **B: Core Paper Refresh** | New paper as core, merge missing material | ~4-6 hours |
| **C: Full Refresh** | Complete documentation overhaul | ~8-12 hours |

**Recommendation**: Option B - best balance of thoroughness and effort

## Session Close

**Status**: CLOSED
**Duration**: Brief (context review + merge analysis)
**Interaction Count**: 2

### Next Session Pickup
- User to decide on merge approach (A/B/C)
- Execute selected merge strategy
- Both new files remain untracked pending decision
