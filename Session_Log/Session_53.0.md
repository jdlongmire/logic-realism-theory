## Em Dash Sweep Details

Replaced em dashes (—) with:
- Colons for explanatory clauses
- Semicolons for closely related independent clauses
- Commas for lighter breaks
- Parentheses for parenthetical content
- En dashes (–) for version indicators only

Papers swept:
1. Born Rule Paper
2. QFT Statistics Paper
3. GR Extension Paper
4. Position Paper
5. Hilbert Space Derivation

## Reference Expansion Details

Added references to 4 working papers (not Position Paper):

**Born Rule Paper** (5→8):
- Caves, Fuchs, & Schack (2002) — QBism/subjective probability
- Schlosshauer (2007) — decoherence review
- Zurek (2003) — environment-induced decoherence

**GR Extension Paper** (4→8):
- Hawking (1975) — black hole radiation
- Malament (1977) — causal structure
- Rovelli (2004) — relational quantum gravity
- Wald (1984) — textbook reference

**QFT Statistics Paper** (6→8):
- French & Redhead (1988) — identity of indiscernibles
- Muller & Saunders (2008) — weak discernibility

**Hilbert Space Derivation** (6→9):
- Bell (1964) — nonlocality theorem
- Popescu & Rohrlich (1994) — PR boxes
- Renou et al. (2021) — local friendliness violation

All citations integrated into paper bodies at appropriate locations.

## Position Paper YAML Removal

Removed YAML frontmatter from Position Paper to fix GitHub viewer display issues.
Converted to plain markdown header format matching other 4 papers.
`_quarto.yml` provides default author metadata for PDF generation.
