# Lean Backup Files - 2025-10-29

**Archived**: 2025-10-29, Session 4.2
**Reason**: Pre-axiom-cleanup backups

## Files

1. **Energy.lean.backup** (30KB)
   - Created: 2025-10-29 15:11
   - Backup of Derivations/Energy.lean before axiom simplification

2. **TimeEmergence.lean.backup** (18KB)
   - Created: 2025-10-26 10:03
   - Backup of Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean before axiom simplification

## Context

These backups were created during the process of:
- Simplifying axiom documentation per user request
- Adding AXIOMS.md references to all .lean files
- Preparing for Sprint 11 (Lean Proof Cleanup)

## Recovery

If needed, these files can be restored by copying them back to:
- `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/Energy.lean`
- `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean`

## Current Status (Session 4.2)

- **Build Status**: FAILED (MeasurementGeometry.lean compilation errors)
- **Axiom Count**: 51 total across 9 modules
- **Sorry Count**: 3 (all in NonUnitaryEvolution.lean)
- **Sprint 11**: PLANNED (not yet started)
