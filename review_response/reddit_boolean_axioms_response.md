## Draft Response

Good catch - those are all axioms of Boolean algebra. But there's a distinction worth making.

The 3FLL are **constitutive of distinguishability itself**:
- Identity: A thing is what it is (a token is self-identical)
- Non-Contradiction: A thing can't both be and not-be something (outcomes are determinate)
- Excluded Middle: A thing either is or isn't something (no third option)

These define what it means for an outcome to be *distinguishable at all*.

Associativity, commutativity, distributivity, idempotence, and absorption are **structural properties of operations** on Boolean values. They tell you how AND, OR, NOT compose once you already have distinguishable truth values.

The claim isn't that 3FLL are the only axioms of Boolean algebra. It's that they're *prior* - they constitute what it means to have determinate outcomes in the first place. The operational properties then follow from how you combine things that are already determinate.

Put differently: You need Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle to have {0,1} as your outcome set. You need the other axioms to define the algebra on that set. The paper is about why physical outcomes live in {0,1} rather than some other structure - that's the 3FLL question, not the full Boolean algebra question.

This also explains why the **bit is fundamental**. The bit isn't fundamental because Shannon chose it as a convenient unit - it's fundamental because 3FLL *force* all actualized outcomes into binary form. Any distinguishable property either obtains or doesn't. That's exactly what a bit IS: a single binary distinction.

Note the subtlety: quantum *states* are continuous (complex Hilbert space, superpositions, interference). The bit emerges at the *interface* - when possibility becomes actuality. Pre-measurement: continuous, non-Boolean. Post-measurement: discrete, Boolean. 3FLL explain why the transition *must* land on bits.

Wheeler asked "why bits?" ("It from Bit"). LRT answers: because distinguishability is constitutively Boolean. The bit structure isn't arbitrary - it's forced by what actuality requires. That's the "Bit from Fit" direction of the paper's title.

## Notes

- Key distinction: constitutive vs operational
- 3FLL define the outcome space; other axioms define operations on it
- Bits are fundamental because 3FLL force binary outcomes, not by convention
- Quantum states are continuous; bits emerge at actualization
- This addresses Wheeler's "It from Bit" question directly
