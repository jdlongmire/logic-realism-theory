## Acknowledgment

I thank the referee for a careful, rigorous, and fair evaluation. The assessment (Accept with Revisions, Grade A-) accurately identifies both the paper's contributions and its genuine vulnerabilities. The three required revisions are reasonable and have been implemented as described below.

## Response to Required Revisions

### Revision 1: Reframing the "Derivation" of Complex Numbers

**Referee critique:** The abstract and introduction risk overstating the "pure logic" aspect. The derivation of complex numbers relies on Axiom A3c (Local Tomography), which is physical, not logical.

**Response:** The referee is correct. While Section 1.6 already disclaimed pure logical derivation, the abstract and introduction have been revised to make this explicit.

**Changes made:**

1. **Abstract (paragraph 3):** Revised from:
   > "complex Hilbert space structure follows from interface constraints and local tomography"

   To:
   > "complex Hilbert space structure follows from interface constraints combined with the physical requirement of compositional consistency (local tomography); ... The derivations are conditional on both logical (3FLL) and physical (continuity, local tomography) inputs, but this combination suffices..."

2. **Section 1.5:** Revised to explicitly state the derivation chain includes "physical requirements (continuity, local tomography)" alongside 3FLL and interface constraints.

These changes bulletproof the paper against the "Trojan Horse" critique by making the physical inputs explicit throughout.

### Revision 2: The Relativistic Gap

**Referee critique:** The lack of a Lorentz-invariant formulation of the Interface is a significant theoretical vulnerability. This should be explicitly categorized as a core open problem.

**Response:** The referee is correct that this deserves explicit treatment alongside the interface criterion problem.

**Changes made:**

A new subsection has been added to Section 7.1 ("What Remains Open"):

> **The relativistic interface:**
>
> LRT explains entanglement as global constraint satisfaction rather than causal signaling. This works naturally in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where simultaneity is well-defined. However, a fully relativistic formulation requires articulating how the IIS/actuality interface respects the causal structure of spacetime.
>
> The challenge: "global constraint" might appear to presuppose a reference frame, while Special Relativity has no universal "now." The resolution lies in recognizing that the constraint is on the IIS state itself (which is a single configuration without spatial parts needing coordination), not on spacetime events. Different reference frames describe measurement orderings differently, but all frames agree on the correlations.
>
> A Lorentz-invariant formulation of the interface, likely using algebraic quantum field theory where local observables respect causal diamond structure, is required for full theoretical completeness. This represents ongoing work analogous in importance to the interface criterion problem.

This elevates the relativistic gap to explicit acknowledgment as a core open problem.

### Revision 3: The Unitarity Bet

**Referee critique:** The text should more starkly highlight that confirmation of fundamental information loss would directly falsify LRT's dynamical core.

**Response:** The referee is correct that this theoretical commitment should be more prominent.

**Changes made:**

A new subsection has been added to Section 6.3 ("The Falsifiers"):

> **Critical falsifier: Fundamental information loss.** The derivation of unitary dynamics (Section 3.5) rests on the Consistency Bridging Principle and Global Parsimony, which require that fundamental dynamics preserve information. This explicitly stakes LRT on the resolution of the Black Hole Information Paradox. If Hawking radiation is confirmed to be truly thermal with fundamental information loss (non-unitary black hole evaporation), this directly falsifies LRT's derivation of the Schrödinger equation. Current theoretical evidence (AdS/CFT correspondence, Page curve derivations) favors information preservation, but this remains an open empirical and theoretical question. LRT's commitment to unitarity is principled, not evasive: information destruction would require a mechanism constituting surplus structure beyond the constitutive base, violating Global Parsimony.

This makes the theoretical bet explicit and prominent.

## Response to Overall Assessment

The referee's characterization of LRT as "a 'Reconstruction Theorem' elevated to an ontology" is accurate and welcome. The paper's goal was never pure rationalist derivation of physics from logic alone, but rather to show that the combination of:

1. 3FLL as constitutive of distinguishability
2. Minimal physical constraints (continuity, local tomography)
3. Interface requirements (totality, single-valuedness, distinguishability-preservation)

...suffices to derive rather than postulate quantum mechanical structure.

The revisions implemented above ensure this more modest but still significant claim is clear throughout.

## Summary of Revisions

| Revision | Location | Change |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1. Derivation reframing | Abstract, Section 1.5 | Explicit acknowledgment that derivations are conditional on physical inputs |
| 2. Relativistic gap | Section 7.1 (new subsection) | Elevated to core open problem status |
| 3. Information loss | Section 6.3 (new subsection) | Explicit acknowledgment as critical falsifier |

All revisions have been implemented. The paper is now responsive to the referee's concerns while maintaining its core contributions.
