# Foundation: Infinite Information Space (I)

This file establishes the MINIMAL axiomatic foundation for Logic Realism Theory.

**Core Thesis**: Physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an Infinite Information Space.
**Principle**: A = L(I) where Actualization = Logical filtering of Infinite Information

**Axiom Count**: 2 (absolute minimum)
**Strategy**: Everything else defined or derived using Lean's built-in logic.

## The Two Axioms

These are the ONLY axioms in the entire theory. All quantum mechanics, time, energy, measurement,
and even the 3FLL operations are DEFINED or DERIVED.

-- Imports
import Mathlib.Algebra.CharZero.Infinite

-- Import classical logic for excluded middle
open Classical

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- AXIOMS (2 total - absolute minimum)
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- Axiom 1: Infinite Information Space exists
axiom I : Type*

-- Axiom 2: I is infinite (prevents trivial finite spaces)
axiom I_infinite : Infinite I

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- 3FLL (Definitions using Lean's built-in logic - NOT axioms)
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- Identity: Already built into Lean's equality (reflexivity)
theorem identity_law (x : I) : x = x := rfl

-- Non-Contradiction: Derivable in Lean's logic
theorem non_contradiction_law (P : I → Prop) (x : I) : ¬(P x ∧ ¬P x) :=
  fun h => h.2 h.1

-- Excluded Middle: Available via Classical logic
theorem excluded_middle_law (P : I → Prop) (x : I) : P x ∨ ¬P x :=
  Classical.em (P x)

-- The 3FLL as a unified structure (L operator - not an axiom, a definition)
structure LogicalConstraints where
  identity : ∀ (x : I), x = x
  non_contradiction : ∀ (P : I → Prop) (x : I), ¬(P x ∧ ¬P x)
  excluded_middle : ∀ (P : I → Prop) (x : I), P x ∨ ¬P x

-- L is DEFINED (not axiomatized) as the application of 3FLL to I
def L : LogicalConstraints := {
  identity := identity_law
  non_contradiction := non_contradiction_law
  excluded_middle := excluded_middle_law
}

## Important Notes

**Why ONLY 2 axioms?**:
- **I existence**: Foundational postulate (like "Set exists" in ZFC)
- **I infinite**: Core to theory (prevents trivial finite spaces)
- **3FLL**: Already in Lean's logic! No axioms needed.
  - Identity: Proven via `rfl` (reflexivity)
  - Non-Contradiction: Proven via `fun h => h.2 h.1`
  - Excluded Middle: Available via `Classical.em`

**What is NOT an axiom** (defined or proven):
- **L (3FLL)**: DEFINITION (structure bundling the three laws)
- **Π_id**: DEFINITION (identity projector in Operators/Projectors.lean)
- **{Π_i}**: DEFINITION (incompatibility family)
- **R**: DEFINITION (resolution map/Booleanization)
- **A**: DEFINITION (actualized subspace A = L(I))
- **Hilbert space ℋ**: IMPORT from Mathlib (0 new axioms)
- **Time emergence**: THEOREM (Stone's theorem)
- **Energy**: THEOREM (Spohn's inequality)
- **Born rule**: THEOREM (maximum entropy)
- **Superposition**: THEOREM (partial constraint)
- **Measurement collapse**: THEOREM (full constraint)

**Philosophical Significance**:
The entire framework derives from just TWO ontological commitments:
1. An infinite informational substrate exists
2. That's it. Everything else follows from logic.

The 3FLL are not additional axioms but inherent features of reasoning itself,
already present in Lean's type theory and classical logic.

**Next Steps**:
1. Define actualization A in `Foundation/Actualization.lean`
2. Define operators (Π_id, {Π_i}, R) in `Operators/Projectors.lean`
3. Prove time emergence in `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean`
4. Prove energy emergence in `Derivations/Energy.lean`
5. Prove Born rule in `Derivations/BornRule.lean`
