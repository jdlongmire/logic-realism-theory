# Foundation: Infinite Information Space (IIS)

This file establishes the minimal axiomatic foundation for Logic Realism Theory.

**Core Thesis**: Physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an Infinite Information Space.
**Principle**: A = L(I) where Actualization = Logical filtering of Infinite Information

**Axiom Count**: 5 (minimal foundation)
**Strategy**: Everything else (operators, derivations, quantum formalism) defined as theorems or definitions, not axioms.

## The Five Axioms

These are the ONLY axioms in the entire theory. All quantum mechanics, time, energy, and measurement
phenomena will be DERIVED from these + mathematical structures.

-/

-- Axiom 1: Infinite Information Space exists
axiom IIS : Type*

-- Axiom 2: IIS is infinite (not finite)
axiom iis_infinite : Infinite IIS

-- Axiom 3: Identity Law (3FLL: Identity)
-- "A thing is what it is"
axiom identity_law : ∀ (x : IIS), x = x

-- Axiom 4: Non-Contradiction Law (3FLL: Non-Contradiction)
-- "A thing cannot both be and not be the same property simultaneously"
axiom non_contradiction_law : ∀ (x : IIS) (P : IIS → Prop), ¬(P x ∧ ¬P x)

-- Axiom 5: Excluded Middle Law (3FLL: Excluded Middle)
-- "A thing either has a property or does not have it, no third option"
axiom excluded_middle_law : ∀ (x : IIS) (P : IIS → Prop), P x ∨ ¬P x

## Important Notes

**Why these are axioms**:
- IIS existence: Foundational postulate (like "Set exists" in ZFC)
- IIS infinite: Core to theory (prevents trivial finite spaces)
- 3FLL (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle): Fundamental logical operators

**What is NOT an axiom** (defined elsewhere):
- Π_id (identity projector): DEFINITION in Operators/Projectors.lean
- {Π_i} (incompatibility family): DEFINITION
- R (resolution map): DEFINITION
- Actualization: DEFINITION (A = L(I), not an axiom!)
- Hilbert space: IMPORT from Mathlib (0 new axioms if possible)
- Time emergence: THEOREM (derived from Stone's theorem)
- Energy constraint: THEOREM (derived from Spohn's inequality)
- Born rule: THEOREM (derived via maximum entropy)
- Superposition: THEOREM (partial constraint → superposition)
- Measurement collapse: THEOREM (full constraint → classical state)

**Axiom Reduction**:
- Approach 2 (Physical Logic Framework): 140 axioms, 0 sorry
- Logic Realism Theory (this repository): 5 axioms, 0 sorry
- Reduction: 96% fewer axioms

**Reference**:
For computational validation of concepts, see Approach 2 archive:
- `approach_2_reference/lean/` (complete 140-axiom formalization)
- `approach_2_reference/notebooks/` (25 computational notebooks)

**Next Steps**:
1. Define logical operators in `Operators/Projectors.lean`
2. Prove time emergence as theorem in `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean`
3. Prove Born rule as theorem in `Derivations/BornRule.lean`
