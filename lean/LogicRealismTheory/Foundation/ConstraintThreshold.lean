# Constraint Threshold Foundations

This module defines the foundational concepts of constraint thresholds in Logic Realism Theory.

**Core Concepts**:
- ConstraintViolations: Counts logical inconsistencies in a configuration
- StateSpace: Valid configurations at a given constraint threshold K
- Monotonicity: Lower thresholds yield smaller state spaces

**Refactoring Context**: This module was created during Session 5.3 refactoring to consolidate
measurement modules. Base definitions extracted from Common.lean into Foundation layer following
the approach_2_reference pattern.

## Main definitions

* `ConstraintViolations σ` - Number of constraint violations for configuration σ
* `StateSpace K` - Set of configurations with at most K violations
* `statespace_monotone` - Axiom: K' ≤ K implies StateSpace K' ⊆ StateSpace K

## Foundational Theory

In Logic Realism Theory, information space I contains all possible configurations. The logical
operator L filters I based on constraint satisfaction. Constraint threshold K determines how many
constraint violations are tolerated, with K=0 being fully consistent with actuality A.

**AXIOM INVENTORY**: For complete axiom documentation, see: lean/AXIOMS.md
This module uses 3 foundational axioms:
- Set.card (cardinality for mathematical infrastructure)
- ConstraintViolations (foundational structure of LRT)
- statespace_monotone (monotonicity principle)

Axiomatize Set cardinality (not available in current Mathlib version).

**STATUS**: Mathematical infrastructure axiom
**JUSTIFICATION**: Standard set theory, axiomatized until we upgrade to Mathlib version with Set.ncard
-/
axiom Set.card {α : Type*} : Set α → ℕ

/--
Number of constraint violations for a configuration.

**FOUNDATIONAL AXIOM**: This is the core structure in LRT measurement theory.

**Physical Interpretation**: Each configuration σ in information space I has a certain number
of logical constraint violations. When K=0, the configuration is fully consistent (in actuality A).
As K increases, more "near-miss" configurations are included in the state space.

**Implementation Note**: The specific constraints depend on the physical system being modeled.
This axiom establishes the existence of such a counting function without specifying the
constraint details.

axiom ConstraintViolations {V : Type*} : V → ℕ

/--
State space at constraint threshold K: all configurations with ≤ K violations.

**Definition**: StateSpace K = {σ ∈ V | ConstraintViolations(σ) ≤ K}

**Physical Interpretation**: This is the set of "approximately actual" configurations.
K=0 gives the fully actualized states (A), K>0 gives quantum superpositions in LRT.
-/
def StateSpace {V : Type*} (K : ℕ) : Set V := {σ : V | ConstraintViolations σ ≤ K}

/--
Monotonicity: Lower constraint thresholds yield smaller state spaces.

**AXIOM**: K' ≤ K implies StateSpace(K') ⊆ StateSpace(K)

**Justification**: If K' ≤ K, then any configuration with ≤ K' violations also has ≤ K violations.
This is a direct consequence of the definition of StateSpace, but we axiomatize it for use in
measurement operator proofs.

**Physical Interpretation**: Tightening constraints (lowering K) reduces the allowed configurations.
This is the mechanism of wavefunction collapse in LRT: measurement adds constraints, reducing K.

axiom statespace_monotone {V : Type*} {K K' : ℕ} (h : K' ≤ K) :
  (StateSpace K' : Set V) ⊆ (StateSpace K : Set V)
