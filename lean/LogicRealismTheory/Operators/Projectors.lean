# Operators: Projectors and Constraint Application

This file defines the three fundamental operators that implement L's constraint application:
- Π_id (persistence projector): Identity constraint
- {Π_i} (incompatibility family): Non-Contradiction constraint
- R (resolution map): Excluded Middle constraint

**Reference**: Foundational paper Section 3.3 (Operator-Algebraic Structure of L)

**Composition**: L = EM ∘ NC ∘ Id (right-to-left application)
- Id: ℋ → ℋ_Id (restrict to persistent entities)
- NC: ℋ_Id → ℋ_NC (exclude incompatible states)
- EM: ℋ_NC → 𝒜 (force binary resolution)

Acts on paths γ: [0,t] → ℋ representing state evolution, projecting onto
the subspace of paths that maintain coherent identity relations.

**Operational Meaning**: Ensures that actualized entities exhibit causal
continuity and conservation laws. Excludes information patterns where entity
identity fails to persist coherently.

**Mathematical Structure**:
- Domain: Paths in Hilbert space ℋ
- Codomain: Subspace ℋ_Id ⊆ ℋ of identity-preserving paths
- Property: Π_id(γ) = γ iff ∀s,t : γ(s) and γ(t) represent same entity
-/
structure PersistenceProjector (H : Type*) where
  /-- Paths in the Hilbert space (parameterized by time) -/
  path : (ℝ → H) → Prop
  /-- The projection operation: keeps only identity-preserving paths -/
  project : (γ : ℝ → H) → path γ → (ℝ → H)
  /-- Predicate: two states represent the same entity under unitary evolution -/
  represents_same_entity : H → H → Prop
  /-- Identity preservation: projected path equals original if identity maintained -/
  identity_preserving : ∀ (γ : ℝ → H) (h : path γ),

**Foundational Paper**: Section 3.3, lines 134-140

Family of projectors {Π_i}_{i∈I} where each Π_i corresponds to a determinate
state or property. Incompatible projectors satisfy orthogonality condition:

  Π_i Π_j = 0  for incompatible i ≠ j

**Operational Meaning**: Enforces that mutually exclusive states cannot be
simultaneously actualized. For quantum observables with incompatible eigenstates,
NC ensures orthogonality. Projection from ℋ to 𝒜 excludes superpositions that
violate these incompatibility relations for fully actualized states.

**Mathematical Structure**:
- Indexed family of projectors
- Orthogonality condition for incompatible indices
- Exclusion of incompatible simultaneous actualizations
-/

  /-- The family of projectors, one for each index -/

Selects a Boolean ultrafilter over {Π_i}, forcing binary resolution:

  R: {Π_i} → {0,1}  subject to  Σ_i R(Π_i) = 1

**Operational Meaning**: Represents measurement or interaction forcing a
definite outcome. In category-theoretic terms, R is the functor right adjoint
to Bool → Heyt inclusion (Booleanization right adjoint). Concretely, R maps
quantum logic's orthomodular lattice to its Boolean skeleton by forcing
distributivity.

**Mathematical Structure**:
- Maps incompatibility family to binary outcomes {0,1}
- Normalization: exactly one outcome selected (Σ_i R(Π_i) = 1)
- Forces binary resolution (measurement collapse)
-/
structure ResolutionMap (Index : Type*) where
  /-- The resolution function mapping indices to binary outcomes -/
  resolve : Index → Fin 2  -- Fin 2 = {0, 1} in Lean
  /-- Normalization: exactly one index resolves to 1 -/
  normalization : ∃! (i : Index), resolve i = 1

R applied to I (resolution map for LRT).

This is the concrete instantiation of the resolution map for LRT.
Note: We use Classical.choice to select an arbitrary element for resolution.
Specific resolutions in actual measurements depend on interaction context.

Constraint composition structure implementing L = EM ∘ NC ∘ Id.

**Foundational Paper**: Section 3.3, lines 150-160

The constraint application follows right-to-left composition:
- Id: ℋ → ℋ_Id (restrict to persistent entities with causal continuity)
- NC: ℋ_Id → ℋ_NC (exclude incompatible simultaneous actualizations)
- EM: ℋ_NC → 𝒜 (force binary resolution / measurement)

**Operational Sequence**:
1. Id first restricts to persistent entities
2. NC then excludes incompatible states from identity-constrained states
3. EM finally forces binary resolution to produce definite actualized states

**Non-Commutativity**: The operators are non-commutative in general.

**Partial vs. Full Constraint**:
- Id + NC together = quantum superposition (partial constraint)
- Id + NC + EM = classical definite state (full constraint)
