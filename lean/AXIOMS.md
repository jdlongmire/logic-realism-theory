# Axiom Approach

**Logic Realism Theory - Lean 4 Formalization**

---

## Axiom Philosophy

Axioms in this formalization fall into two categories:

1. **Foundational postulates** - Theory-defining assumptions that establish what LRT is (analogous to quantum mechanics' Hilbert space postulate)

2. **Established results** - Well-known mathematical or physical principles whose formal proofs would require extensive Mathlib development without adding physical insight

Both categories represent deliberate design choices in the formalization strategy.
