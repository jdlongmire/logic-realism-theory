# Axiom Approach

**Logic Realism Theory - Lean 4 Formalization**

---

## Current Status

As an active research program, axiom counts and sorry statements may vary as development progresses.

**Main Build** (as of 2025-10-29):
- **Axioms**: 6 (2 foundational + 4 established principles)
- **Sorry statements**: 0
- **Build status**: SUCCESS

## Axiom Philosophy

LRT uses 6 axioms: 2 foundational postulates (I exists, I infinite) and 4 established mathematical/physical principles (Stone's theorem, Jaynes MaxEnt, Spohn's inequality, energy additivity).

These are axiomatized rather than proven because they're either:
1. **Theory-defining postulates** - Core assumptions that define what LRT is (like QM's Hilbert space postulate)
2. **Established results** - Well-known mathematical/physical principles whose formal proofs would require extensive Mathlib work without adding physical insight

**Goal**: Minimize axioms and eliminate sorry statements where practical, while maintaining research flexibility.

## Quick Inventory

### Foundation Axioms (2)
- Information space I exists
- Information space I is infinite

### Established Principles (4)
- Stone's theorem (unitary groups â†” self-adjoint generators)
- Jaynes Maximum Entropy Principle
- Spohn's inequality (entropy change bounds)
- Energy additivity for independent systems

**Note**: Full justifications and references available in individual Lean module files.

## Verification

```bash
cd lean

# Count axioms in main build
grep -r "^axiom" LogicRealismTheory/Foundation/*.lean \
                 LogicRealismTheory/Operators/*.lean \
                 LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/*.lean | wc -l

# Count sorry statements
grep -r "^ *sorry$" LogicRealismTheory/Foundation/*.lean \
                    LogicRealismTheory/Operators/*.lean \
                    LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/*.lean | wc -l

# Verify build
lake build LogicRealismTheory
```
