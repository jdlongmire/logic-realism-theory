# README Audit Report - October 27, 2025

**Purpose**: Comprehensive review of all active repository READMEs for accuracy, conciseness, and proper linking

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-27
**Current Session**: 3.6
**Current Focus**: Path 3 T1 vs T2 Protocol (simulation-validated)

---

## Executive Summary

**Files Reviewed**: 8 active READMEs
**Status**: ⚠️ Most READMEs contain outdated information requiring updates
**Priority**: High (READMEs are primary entry points for repository navigation)

**Key Issues**:
1. ❌ **Outdated predictions**: Several READMEs still cite β as "primary prediction" (should be Path 3: T2/T1)
2. ❌ **Outdated status**: Sprint system appears abandoned but still listed as "In Progress"
3. ❌ **Missing links**: Many cross-references are plain text instead of active links
4. ❌ **Session context**: Most READMEs don't reflect current Session 3.6 work
5. ❌ **Repetition**: Excessive duplication of content across READMEs

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Root README.md ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**File**: `README.md`
**Status**: Needs significant updates
**Last Verified Content**: October 25-26, 2025 (Session 3.2-3.4)

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Line 28: Outdated Primary Prediction**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Primary Testable Prediction: β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Primary Prediction: T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 (Path 3 protocol, simulation-validated)"
   ```

2. **Line 32: Incorrect Sorry Status**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Formal Verification: Lean 4 proofs with 0 sorry statements (target)"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Formal Verification: Lean 4 proofs with mathematical rigor (see lean/README.md for status)"
   ```
   **Reason**: Session 3.5 identified axiomatized theorems (not sorry, but not fully proven from axioms)

3. **Line 33: Outdated Notebook Count**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "9 focused Jupyter notebooks (in development)"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "QuTiP simulations and experimental protocols (see notebooks/ and theory/predictions/)"
   ```

4. **Missing Content**:
   - No mention of Session 3.6 work (QuTiP validation, error budget)
   - No mention of quantitative predictions (T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9)
   - No mention of multi-LLM team review (Session 3.6)

5. **Missing Active Links**:
   ```markdown
   ❌ "theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md"
   ✅ [`theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`](theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md)

   ❌ "multi_LLM/README.md"
   ✅ [`multi_LLM/README.md`](multi_LLM/README.md)

   ❌ "Program_Auditor_Agent.md"
   ✅ [`Program_Auditor_Agent.md`](Program_Auditor_Agent.md)
   ```

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Update primary prediction to Path 3 (T2/T1)
2. Add links to Session 3.6 work (QuTiP notebook, error budget)
3. Convert all file references to active links
4. Add "Status Summary" section with current focus

---

### 2. multi_LLM/README.md ✅ MOSTLY GOOD

**File**: `multi_LLM/README.md`
**Status**: Well-maintained, minor updates needed
**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025

**Minor Issues**:

1. **Line 554: Outdated Date**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Last Updated: 2025-10-09"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Last Updated: 2025-10-27"
   ```

2. **Line 507: Outdated Test Date**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Test Date: 2025-10-03"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Test Date: 2025-10-27 (or latest run date)"
   ```

3. **Missing Recent Work**:
   - No mention of Session 3.6 Path 3 protocol review
   - No link to `consultation/path3_t1_vs_t2_review_20251027.txt`

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Update dates to October 27, 2025
2. Add "Recent Consultations" section linking to Path 3 review

**Positive Features** (keep these):
- ✅ Excellent structure and organization
- ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting
- ✅ Good code examples
- ✅ Clear security notes

---

### 3. notebooks/README.md ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATES

**File**: `notebooks/README.md`
**Status**: Outdated, missing recent work

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Line 22: Outdated Primary Prediction**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "08_Beta_Prediction.ipynb - β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction (PRIMARY TESTABLE PREDICTION)"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: Remove "(PRIMARY TESTABLE PREDICTION)" or update to reference Path 3
   ```

2. **Line 8: Incomplete Notebook Count**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Notebook Sequence (9 Total)"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: Update to include Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb
   ```

3. **Missing Recent Notebooks**:
   - `Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb` (created Session 3.6)
   - No mention of experimental protocols folder

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Add Path 3 QuTiP validation notebook to list
2. Update primary prediction reference
3. Add link to [`theory/predictions/`](theory/predictions/) for protocols

---

### 4. sprints/README.md ❌ SEVERELY OUTDATED

**File**: `sprints/README.md`
**Status**: **CRITICALLY OUTDATED** - Sprint system appears abandoned
**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025 (Session 1.6)

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Sprint System Status**:
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Sprint 2 | Physical Derivations | In Progress | 2025-10-25 | TBD"
   ```
   - We're now on Session 3.6 (October 27)
   - Sprint system was not used in Sessions 2.x or 3.x
   - No sprint tracking documents have been updated

2. **Abandoned Workflow**:
   - Sprint folders exist but aren't being used
   - Session_Log/ has replaced sprint tracking
   - No sprint updates since Session 1.6

**Recommended Actions**:

**Option A: Deprecate Sprint System**
```markdown
# Sprint Overview - DEPRECATED

**Note**: The sprint system was used for Sessions 1.x but has been superseded by the Session_Log/ tracking system as of Session 2.0.

For current development tracking, see [`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/).

## Historical Sprint Records

[Keep existing content for historical reference]

**Last Active Sprint**: Sprint 1 (completed Session 1.6, October 25, 2025)
```

**Option B: Update Sprint System**
- Create Sprint 3 for Sessions 3.x work
- Update all sprint tracking documents
- **Effort**: High, may not be worth it if system is abandoned

**Recommendation**: Choose Option A (deprecate) - Session_Log/ is more comprehensive

---

### 5. lean/README.md ⚠️ MINOR UPDATES

**File**: `lean/README.md`
**Status**: Mostly current, minor updates needed

**Issues**:

1. **Line 39: Last Updated Date**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Last Updated: 2025-10-26"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Last Updated: 2025-10-27 (or verify current build status)"
   ```

2. **Missing Links**:
   - Plain text references to other folders should be links

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Update date
2. Convert folder references to active links
3. Add reference to Session_Log/ for historical context

---

### 6. theory/predictions/README.md ⚠️ OUTDATED CONTENT

**File**: `theory/predictions/README.md`
**Status**: Missing Path 3 work, uses outdated terminology

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Missing Path 3 Protocol**:
   - `T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md` not mentioned
   - `T1_vs_T2_Error_Budget.md` not mentioned
   - `Quantitative_Predictions_Derivation.md` not mentioned

2. **Outdated Terminology**:
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Phase 3 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 4"
   ```
   - This references old "Logical State-Dependent Error" test
   - Path 3 (T1 vs T2) is current active work

3. **Confusing Organization**:
   - Mixes old test designs with current protocols
   - Not clear which tests are active vs historical

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Add "Active Protocols" section listing:
   - Path 3: T1 vs T2 Comparison
   - Path 5: Frequency Shift (planned)
2. Move old test designs to "Historical" section
3. Add links to Session 3.6 work

---

### 7. scripts/path3_t1_vs_t2/README.md ✅ CURRENT

**File**: `scripts/path3_t1_vs_t2/README.md`
**Status**: Up to date and accurate

**Positive Features**:
- ✅ Clear structure
- ✅ Current status
- ✅ Good code examples

**Minor Improvements**:
- Could add link to protocol document
- Could add link to error budget

---

### 8. docs/README.md ❌ SEVERELY OUTDATED

**File**: `docs/README.md`
**Status**: **CRITICALLY OUTDATED**

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Line 26: Incorrect Session Reference**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Current Stage: Initial repository setup (Session 0.0-0.1)"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Current Stage: Active research (Session 3.6, October 2025)"
   ```

2. **Line 28: Incorrect Documentation Status**
   ```markdown
   ❌ CURRENT: "Documentation files are stubs and will be developed progressively"
   ✅ SHOULD BE: "Documentation files reference main theory paper (see theory/)"
   ```

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Update to current session (3.6)
2. Update status from "stubs" to actual state
3. Add links to theory/ and Session_Log/

---

## Common Improvements Across All READMEs

### 1. Active Links

**Pattern to apply everywhere**:
```markdown
❌ WRONG: "See theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md"
✅ RIGHT: "See [`theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`](theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md)"
```

### 2. Session References

**Add to all READMEs**:
```markdown
**Latest Session**: [Session 3.6](../Session_Log/Session_3.6.md) - Multi-LLM Team Review + Gap Remediation
**Development History**: [`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/)
```

### 3. Current Prediction

**Consistent phrasing across all READMEs**:
```markdown
**Primary Testable Prediction**: T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 (Path 3 protocol, simulation-validated)
- Protocol: [`theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md`](theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md)
- QuTiP Validation: [`notebooks/Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb`](notebooks/Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb)
- Error Budget: [`theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Error_Budget.md`](theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Error_Budget.md)
```

### 4. Reduce Repetition

**Strategy**:
- Each README should be concise and focused on its folder
- Cross-reference other READMEs instead of duplicating content
- Use "See X for details" pattern

**Example**:
```markdown
❌ WRONG (in notebooks/README.md):
"LRT derives quantum mechanics from three fundamental laws of logic..."
[200 words explaining theory]

✅ RIGHT:
"For theoretical foundation, see [`theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`](theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md)"
```

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment**: Most READMEs require updates to reflect current work (Session 3.6, Path 3 protocol)

**Highest Impact Updates**:
1. Root README.md - Main entry point, needs Path 3 focus
2. notebooks/README.md - Missing recent work
3. theory/predictions/README.md - Missing Path 3 protocols

**Recommended Approach**:
- Update top 3 high-priority READMEs first
- Convert all file references to active links
- Add Session_Log/ references for development history

**Next Steps**: User can approve this audit and implement updates, or request modifications to the recommended changes.
