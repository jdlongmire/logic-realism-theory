## Core Thesis

The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) — Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle — are not merely rules of reasoning but **ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality**.

**Key Result**: Complex quantum mechanics is the unique probabilistic theory satisfying LRT axioms.

**Derivation chain**: 3FLL → Distinguishability metric D → Inner product ⟨·|·⟩ → MM1-MM5 → Complex QM
