## Core Thesis

The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) — Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle — are not merely rules of reasoning but **ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality**.

**Formal Expression**: A = L(I)
- **I** = Infinite Information Space (all distinguishable states)
- **L** = Logical filtering (3FLL + parsimony)
- **A** = Actuality (physical reality)

**Key Claims**:
- Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality
- The Born rule follows from Gleason's theorem given Hilbert space structure
- Hilbert space follows from reconstruction theorems given physical constraints
- This is structural fine-tuning, not derivation from logic alone

## Future Decisions

- **T2/T1 Prediction Status**: Review whether the T2/T1 ≈ 0.81 prediction (from prior variational framework) should be included in the current 5-paper structure, modified, or retired given the shift from "derivation" to "structural fine-tuning" framing.
