The foundational document of this repository. Logic Realism Theory treats the three classical logical laws (Determinate Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) as ontological constraints on physical instantiation. The framework derives quantum structure from these constraints: the Born rule emerges via Gleason's theorem from vehicle-invariance requirements; complex Hilbert space is selected by local tomography constraints.

## Core Thesis

The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic ($L_3$):
- **Determinate Identity**: Every entity is determinately what it is
- **Non-Contradiction**: No entity is both P and not-P in the same respect
- **Excluded Middle**: Every entity is either P or not-P

These are not merely rules of inference but **ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality**. A configuration without determinate identity is not a borderline entity; it is nothing.
