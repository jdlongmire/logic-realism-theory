## Core Thesis

The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle - are not merely rules of reasoning but **ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality**.

**Key Result**: Complex quantum mechanics is the unique probabilistic theory satisfying LRT axioms.

**Derivation chain**: 3FLL -> Distinguishability metric D -> Inner product -> MM1-MM5 -> Complex QM

**Assessment**: See [Logic Realism Theory: An Internal Clear-eyed Assessment](theory/LRT_Internal_Assessment.md) for an honest evaluation of what the theory has established, what remains open, and where it stands as a research program.

## Supplementary Papers

Working papers in `theory/supplementary/`:

| Paper | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **IIS-LRT: Obviating Many-Worlds** | Active | Framework combining Infinite Information Space with LRT via three-stage ontology (Representable/Permissible/Actual). Argues parsimony favors IIS-LRT over MWI: same explanatory work, fewer actual entities. Includes "opportunistic" probability model and full objections/responses. |
| **Scale Law of Boolean Actualization** | Draft | Operational framework for decoherence-driven classicality. Defines Boolean actualization time using logical entropy. Validated across 7 platforms. Key insight: scaling exponent diagnoses noise correlation structure. |
| **The Fundamental Laws of Physical Reality** | Draft | Formal statement of 3FLL as ontological laws. Argues these are universal, exceptionless, necessary for coherent physics, and ontologically prior to all other physical laws. |
| **LRT Prediction: Beta Bound Development** | Active | Development of the prediction that decoherence scaling exponent is bounded by 2. Distinguishes LRT's necessary constraint from standard QM's contingent observation. |

## IIS-LRT Three-Stage Framework

The Infinite Information Space (IIS) combined with LRT proposes a three-stage ontological structure:

```
REPRESENTABLE (Stage 1: all formal structures, including incoherent)
    ↓ [structural: LRT defines boundary]
PERMISSIBLE (Stage 2: LRT-compliant; physics lives here; Born measure defined here)
    ↓ [dynamical: selection with probability]
ACTUAL (Stage 3: single outcome recorded)
```

**Key insight**: MWI and IIS-LRT share Stages 1-2 but diverge at Stage 3:
- **MWI**: ALL outcomes actualize (in different branches)
- **IIS-LRT**: ONE outcome actualizes; others remain merely permissible

Parsimony favors IIS-LRT: same explanatory work, no ontological explosion.

See `theory/supplementary/IIS_LRT_Three_Stage_Framework.md` for details.
