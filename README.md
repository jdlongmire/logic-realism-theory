# Logic Realism Theory (LRT)

**Physical Foundations from Logical Constraints**

---

## Core Thesis

The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (L₃) are ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality:

| Law | Constraint |
|-----|------------|
| **Determinate Identity** | Every entity is determinately what it is |
| **Non-Contradiction** | No entity is both P and not-P |
| **Excluded Middle** | Every entity is either P or not-P |

**Derivation Chain:**
```
L₃ → Distinguishability → Hilbert Space → Born Rule → Quantum Mechanics
```
