## Overview

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes that physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an infinite information space via the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL): Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle.

**Core Principle**: A = L(I)
- **I**: Infinite Information Space (unconstrained possibilities)
- **L**: Logical filtering (3FLL as ontological operators)
- **A**: Physical actualization (reality)

---

## Key Features

1. **Complete Foundational Paper**: 640 lines, publication-ready with full formalization (theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md)
2. **Philosophical Foundation**: Proves why 3FLL are necessary conditions for being, information, and determinacy
3. **Operator Formalism**: Π_id (identity projector), {Π_i} (incompatibility family), R (resolution map/Booleanization)
4. **Explicit Derivations**: Time (Stone's theorem), Energy (Spohn's inequality), Russell's paradox filtering
5. **Primary Testable Prediction**: β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction (β ~ 0.1-0.5, testable on NISQ devices)
6. **Ultra-Minimal Axioms**: 2 axioms only (I exists, I infinite)
7. **3FLL as Theorems**: Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle proven using Lean's built-in logic (not axiomatized!)
8. **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 proofs with 0 sorry statements (target)
9. **Computational Validation**: 9 focused Jupyter notebooks (in development)

## Quick Start

### Theory
Read `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` for the complete framework (30,000 words, publication-ready).

### Computational Validation
```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# Start with 01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb
```

### Formal Proofs (Lean 4)

**Prerequisites**:
- Install [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) via elan (Lean version manager)
- Lake build tool (comes with Lean 4)

**Setup**:
```bash
# Install elan (Lean version manager) if not already installed
# On Linux/macOS:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# On Windows:
# Download and run: https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory
cd logic-realism-theory/lean

# Update dependencies (downloads Mathlib and other packages)
lake update

# Build the project (may take several minutes on first run due to Mathlib)
lake build
```

**Current Status**:
- **Axioms**: 2 (I exists, I infinite)
- **Sorry**: 0 (absolute proof completeness)
- **Modules**: Foundation (IIS, 3FLL), Operators (Π_id, {Π_i}, R, L)

**File Structure**:
```
lean/LogicRealismTheory/
├── Foundation/
│   └── IIS.lean           # 2 axioms, 3FLL proven as theorems
└── Operators/
    └── Projectors.lean    # Π_id, {Π_i}, R, L operators (0 sorry)
```

**Lean Configuration**:
- Project: `LogicRealismTheory`
- Lean version: 4.25.0-rc2 (managed by elan)
- Dependencies: Mathlib (for Hilbert space theory, classical logic)

**Troubleshooting**:
- **First build is slow**: Mathlib download and compilation can take 10-30 minutes on first run. Subsequent builds are much faster.
- **Build errors after git pull**: Run `lake update` to refresh dependencies, then `lake build`
- **Missing Mathlib**: Ensure you ran `lake update` before `lake build`
- **Elan not found**: Add elan to your PATH or restart your terminal after installation
- **Checking proof status**: Run `grep -r "sorry" lean/LogicRealismTheory --include="*.lean"` to verify 0 sorry statements

**VS Code Integration** (recommended):
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Lean 4 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leanprover.lean4)
3. Open `lean/` folder in VS Code
4. Lean extension will provide syntax highlighting, error checking, and interactive theorem proving

## Key Results

1. **Time Emergence**: Stone's theorem → U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)
2. **Energy Derivation**: Spohn's inequality → E ∝ ΔS
3. **Born Rule**: MaxEnt + 3FLL → p(x) = |⟨x|ψ⟩|²
4. **Superposition**: Partial constraint (Id + NC, not EM)
5. **Measurement**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) → collapse
6. **β Prediction**: QEC error rates correlate with entropy (β > 0)
