## Overview

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes that physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an infinite information space via the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL): Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle.

**Core Principle**: A = L(I)
- **I**: Infinite Information Space (unconstrained possibilities)
- **L**: Logical filtering (3FLL as ontological operators)
- **A**: Physical actualization (reality)

## Key Features

1. **Complete Foundational Paper**: 640 lines, publication-ready with full formalization (theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md)
2. **Philosophical Foundation**: Proves why 3FLL are necessary conditions for being, information, and determinacy
3. **Operator Formalism**: Π_id (identity projector), {Π_i} (incompatibility family), R (resolution map/Booleanization)
4. **Explicit Derivations**: Time (Stone's theorem), Energy (Spohn's inequality), Russell's paradox filtering
5. **Primary Testable Prediction**: β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction (β ~ 0.1-0.5, testable on NISQ devices)
6. **Ultra-Minimal Axioms**: 2 axioms only (I exists, I infinite)
7. **3FLL as Theorems**: Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle proven using Lean's built-in logic (not axiomatized!)
8. **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 proofs with 0 sorry statements (target)
9. **Computational Validation**: 9 focused Jupyter notebooks (in development)

## Quick Start

### Theory
Read `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` for the complete framework (30,000 words, publication-ready).

### Computational Validation
```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# Start with 01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb
```

### Formal Proofs
```bash
cd lean
lake build
```

## Key Results

1. **Time Emergence**: Stone's theorem → U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)
2. **Energy Derivation**: Spohn's inequality → E ∝ ΔS
3. **Born Rule**: MaxEnt + 3FLL → p(x) = |⟨x|ψ⟩|²
4. **Superposition**: Partial constraint (Id + NC, not EM)
5. **Measurement**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) → collapse
6. **β Prediction**: QEC error rates correlate with entropy (β > 0)
