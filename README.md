## Overview

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) is a theoretical framework proposing that physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an infinite information space via the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL): Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle.

**Core Principle**: **A = L(I)**
- **I**: Infinite Information Space (unconstrained possibilities)
- **L**: Logical filtering (3FLL as ontological operators)
- **A**: Physical actualization (reality)

This is a **proposed framework** with testable predictions, not yet empirically validated. All claims of derivations are theoretical constructions that require experimental verification.

## Key Features

1. **Theoretical Framework**: Proposes derivations of time (Stone's theorem), energy (Spohn's inequality), and Born rule (MaxEnt + 3FLL)
2. **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 proofs with documented axiomatization - see [`lean/AXIOMS.md`](lean/AXIOMS.md)
3. **Testable Hypothesis**: **η ≈ 0.23 (T2/T1 ≈ 0.81)** from variational optimization
   - **Derivation**: η derived from minimizing constraint violations (β = 3/4 optimal coupling)
   - **Status**: Theoretically motivated hypothesis (requires assumptions: 4-step measurement, thermal resonance)
   - **Protocol**: [`theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md`](theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md)
   - **Error Budget**: [`theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Error_Budget.md`](theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Error_Budget.md)
   - **Notebooks**: [`07_Variational_Beta_Derivation.ipynb`](notebooks/Logic_Realism/07_Variational_Beta_Derivation.ipynb) (derivation), [`05_T2_T1_Derivation.ipynb`](notebooks/Logic_Realism/05_T2_T1_Derivation.ipynb) (validation)
   - **QuTiP Validation**: [`notebooks/Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb`](notebooks/Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb)
4. **Computational Validation**: [QuTiP simulations](notebooks/) and [experimental protocols](theory/predictions/)
5. **AI-Enabled Development**: Multi-paradigm research combining formal verification, computational validation, and multi-LLM quality control

## 🤖 AI-Enabled Research Methodology

This project demonstrates a novel research approach combining theoretical physics, formal verification, and AI augmentation. The methodology is documented in **[AI_Enabled_Theoretical_Physics.md](AI_Enabled_Theoretical_Physics.md)**.

### For Multiple Stakeholder Types

**Theoretical Physicists**: See how AI augmentation enables parallel development of theory, formal proofs, and computational validation—achieving in days what traditionally takes months. Includes multi-LLM quality control preventing ~$15K in wasted experimental resources.

**Formal Methods Community**: Case study of physics formalization with complete axiom transparency, AI-assisted proof development, and systematic documentation. Demonstrates that formal verification can scale to complete physical theories with AI assistance.

**AI Researchers**: Documents a 4-level AI system (Claude Code, Multi-LLM consultation, Program Auditor, Computational validation) achieving 5-10x productivity multiplier. Includes novel patterns: formal-computational co-development, multi-agent quality control, transparency enforcement.

**Research Administrators**: Evidence that independent researchers with AI augmentation can achieve rigor and productivity comparable to research teams. Implications for democratizing theoretical physics research and reducing barriers to entry.

**Key Innovations**:
- **Formal-Computational Co-Development**: Theory ↔ Lean proofs ↔ Simulations developed in parallel (days, not months)
- **Multi-LLM Quality Control**: 3 AI models (Grok-3, GPT-4, Gemini-2.0) with quantitative scoring (threshold ≥0.70) catching critical gaps before expensive experiments
- **Transparency Enforcement**: Complete axiom documentation, verification protocol, machine-checkable proofs
- **Systematic Documentation**: AI-enforced consistency across session logs, sprint tracking, axiom inventories, README files

See [AI_Enabled_Theoretical_Physics.md](AI_Enabled_Theoretical_Physics.md) for the complete methodology case study.

## Quick Start

### Theory

Read **[Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md](Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md)** for the complete theoretical framework.

### Experimental Predictions

**Path 3 Protocol** (T1 vs T2 Comparison - Primary Test):
```bash
# Review protocol
cat theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md

# Run QuTiP validation simulation
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook Path3_T1_vs_T2_QuTiP_Validation.ipynb
```

**Predicted vs. Baseline**:
- **LRT Hypothesis**: η ≈ 0.23 → T2/T1 ≈ 0.81 (19% faster decoherence for superposition states)
- **QM Baseline**: T2/T1 ≈ 1.0 (no state preference)
- **Derivation**: Variational optimization (β = 3/4 optimal coupling from minimizing K_total)
- **Error Budget**: ±2.8% measurement precision
- **Signal-to-Noise**: ~6.8σ (if hypothesis correct)
- **Statistical Power**: >95% with 40,000 shots per point

**Status**: Protocol ready, simulation-validated, awaiting quantum hardware execution.

### Formal Proofs (Lean 4)

**Prerequisites**: [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) via elan

```bash
# Install elan (Lean version manager)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory
cd logic-realism-theory/lean
lake update && lake build
```

**Expected**: 3008 jobs, 0 errors, some linter warnings (non-blocking)

See [`lean/README.md`](lean/README.md) for details.

## Theoretical Derivations (Proposed)

1. **Time Emergence**: Stone's theorem → U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)
2. **Energy Definition**: Spohn's inequality → E ∝ ΔS
3. **Born Rule**: MaxEnt + 3FLL → p(x) = |⟨x|ψ⟩|²
4. **Superposition**: Partial constraint (Id + NC, EM relaxed)
5. **Measurement**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) → collapse

*Note: These are theoretical constructions within the LRT framework. Validation requires experimental confirmation of testable predictions.*

## Disclaimer

Logic Realism Theory is a **proposed theoretical framework** under active development. All derivations are theoretical constructions that have not been empirically validated. Testable predictions (T2/T1 decoherence asymmetry) await experimental confirmation on quantum hardware. This work represents independent research and does not represent the views of any institution.
