## Overview

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes that physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an infinite information space via the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL): Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle.

**Core Principle**: A = L(I)
- **I**: Infinite Information Space (unconstrained possibilities)
- **L**: Logical filtering (3FLL as ontological operators)
- **A**: Physical actualization (reality)

## Key Features

1. **Philosophical Foundation**: Justifies why logical constraints (3FLL) are necessary for physics
2. **Operator Formalism**: Abstract mathematical framework (projectors, resolution map)
3. **Quantum Derivations**: Time, energy, Born rule, superposition, measurement from first principles
4. **Testable Prediction**: β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction entropy correlation
5. **Minimal Axioms**: 5-7 axioms (vs. 140 in Approach 2 prototype)
6. **Computational Validation**: 9 focused Jupyter notebooks
7. **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 proofs with 0 sorry statements (target)

## Quick Start

### Theory
Read `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory.md` for the complete framework.

### Computational Validation
```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# Start with 01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb
```

### Formal Proofs
```bash
cd lean
lake build
```

## Approach 2 Archive

This repository builds on lessons learned from a prototype implementation (Physical Logic Framework, 2025). Key achievements archived in `approach_2_reference/`:
- 140 axioms, 0 sorry statements
- 25 computational notebooks
- Symmetric group realization (K(N) = N-2)
- Finite-N corrections (~10^-8 effects)

LRT is a clean rebuild focusing on:
- Minimal axioms (5-7)
- Focused scope (9 core derivations)
- Philosophical clarity (why logic?)
- Primary testable prediction (β ≠ 0)

See `approach_2_reference/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` for detailed analysis.

## Key Results

1. **Time Emergence**: Stone's theorem → U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)
2. **Energy Derivation**: Spohn's inequality → E ∝ ΔS
3. **Born Rule**: MaxEnt + 3FLL → p(x) = |⟨x|ψ⟩|²
4. **Superposition**: Partial constraint (Id + NC, not EM)
5. **Measurement**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) → collapse
6. **β Prediction**: QEC error rates correlate with entropy (β > 0)
