## üìö Key Theoretical Documents

**When working on paper revisions or theoretical derivations, reference these canonical documents:**

### Primary Theory Documents

1. **`theory/LRT_Hierarchical_Emergence_Framework.md`** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REFERENCE
   - **Purpose**: Formal mathematical framework for hierarchical emergence
   - **Contains**:
     - Rigorous definitions of information space structure
     - Constraint operator hierarchy (L_0 ‚Üí L_1 ‚Üí L_2 ‚Üí ...)
     - Emergence dynamics differential equations
     - Entropy reduction formalism
     - Proto-mathematical primitive specifications
   - **When to use**:
     - Formalizing any claims about emergence
     - Defining operators mathematically
     - Addressing "hand-wavy" critiques with rigorous math
     - Writing Sections 3-4 of papers
   - **Key insight**: This document provides the mathematical rigor that underlies qualitative descriptions in papers

2. **`theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`** (old paper - reference only)
   - **Purpose**: Source material for content extraction during rewrites
   - **Status**: Being replaced by v3 rewrite, use as content source but not structure model
   - **Contains**: Existing derivations, philosophical arguments, experimental protocols

3. **`theory/Logic-realism-theory-v3.md`** (NEW - work in progress)
   - **Purpose**: Clean slate rewrite with standard physics paper structure
   - **Status**: Actively being written (Session 4.0+)
   - **Target**: Peer-review ready manuscript with predictions by ~50% mark

### Sprint-Specific Documents

4. **`sprints/sprint_5/SPRINT_5_TRACKING.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Current sprint progress, daily logs, deliverables
   - **Contains**: Track 1 (Energy), Track 2 (Œ∑), Track 3 (Pre-mathematical), Track 4 (Lean honesty)

5. **`NEXT_SESSION_TODOS.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Immediate priorities for next session
   - **Contains**: Priority-ordered task list with time estimates

### Usage Protocol

**Before making any claims about emergence, operators, or mathematical structure:**
1. ‚úÖ Check `LRT_Hierarchical_Emergence_Framework.md` for existing formal definitions
2. ‚úÖ Use the rigorous formalism from that document in papers
3. ‚úÖ Cross-reference between qualitative paper text and quantitative framework doc
4. ‚ùå DO NOT redevelop formalism from scratch - it's already done

**Paper writing workflow:**
1. Draft qualitative narrative in paper (e.g., "proto-primitives enable mathematics")
2. Pull formal definitions from `LRT_Hierarchical_Emergence_Framework.md`
3. Integrate formalism into paper sections
4. Ensure consistency between narrative and mathematics

---

## üéØ Research Philosophy: Collaborative Refinement

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: When facing theoretical obstacles or peer review challenges, the default approach is **collaborative problem-solving to overcome**, NOT weakening claims or abandoning core thesis.

### Core Thesis Non-Negotiable

**The core thesis of Logic Realism Theory** is **A = L(I)** (Actualization = Logical operators applied to Infinite information space).

This core thesis is **non-negotiable** unless proven **logically impossible** (not merely difficult or currently unsolved).

### Response to Obstacles

When encountering theoretical challenges:

**‚úÖ DO**:
1. **Rigorously analyze** the specific logical or mathematical issue
2. **Collaborate** to find solutions that preserve the core thesis
3. **Work through** derivation gaps with careful mathematical development
4. **Strengthen connections** between axioms and predictions through rigorous derivation
5. **Solve open problems** (e.g., deriving phenomenological parameters from first principles)
6. **Refine formulations** to resolve apparent contradictions while maintaining core claims
7. **Build up** missing mathematical infrastructure to support derivations

**‚ùå DO NOT**:
1. Immediately suggest "softening" or "toning down" core claims
2. Recommend "acknowledging limitations" as first response (that's giving up, not solving)
3. Treat difficulties as reasons to weaken the theory
4. Abandon rigorous derivations in favor of phenomenological models (unless absolutely necessary)
5. Accept "this is too hard" as an answer without exhaustive attempts
6. Frame peer review criticism as insurmountable without attempting solutions

### Decision Criteria for Theory Revision

**Only weaken or abandon core claims if**:
- **Logical impossibility** is proven (e.g., derives a contradiction like P ‚àß ¬¨P)
- **Empirical falsification** occurs (experimental data definitively contradicts predictions)
- **All rigorous attempts** to resolve the issue have been exhausted
- **User explicitly decides** to change direction after full analysis

### Examples

**Scenario: Peer review identifies circular derivation in energy section**

‚ùå **WRONG Response**: "Let's soften the claim from 'derivation of energy' to 'consistency relationship'"

‚úÖ **CORRECT Response**: "Let's rigorously analyze the circularity:
1. Where exactly does the argument presuppose what it claims to derive?
2. Can we construct a non-circular derivation from more fundamental principles?
3. What additional axioms or mathematical infrastructure is needed?
4. Can we derive those axioms from A = L(I)?
Let's work through this systematically and only reframe if we prove it's impossible."

**Scenario: Phenomenological parameter Œ∑ lacks first-principles derivation**

‚ùå **WRONG Response**: "Let's just acknowledge Œ∑ is phenomenological and move on"

‚úÖ **CORRECT Response**: "Let's attempt to derive Œ∑:
1. What information-theoretic constraints apply to constraint addition?
2. Can we relate Œ∑ to the constraint threshold K dynamics?
3. What does Œ∑ represent physically in terms of logical constraint operations?
4. Can we construct a derivation from the rate of state space reduction?
Let's exhaust all approaches before accepting it as phenomenological."

### Integration with Sprint Work

This philosophy applies throughout all sprint work:
- Track 1 (Theoretical Derivations): Push for rigorous, first-principles derivations
- Track 2 (Paper Revisions): Strengthen derivations, don't merely acknowledge gaps
- Track 3 (Team Validation): Use criticism to identify what needs solving, not what needs softening

### Protection Against Premature Compromise

If Claude suggests weakening claims without first attempting rigorous solutions:
- **User should push back** (as in this instance)
- **Claude should apologize** and reframe to collaborative problem-solving
- **Update work plan** to focus on solving the identified issues

**Remember**: Obstacles are opportunities for deeper understanding, not reasons to retreat.

## üîç Program Auditor Agent Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Before making ANY claims about project completion status, run the Program Auditor Agent critical review.

**Purpose**: Prevent overclaiming, hype, and disconnect between formal proofs and computational validation.

### When to Run Auditor

**Mandatory audit triggers**:
- ‚úÖ At the start of each new session (after reading session log)
- ‚úÖ Before making any public claims about completion status
- ‚úÖ After completing any sprint or major milestone
- ‚úÖ Monthly comprehensive audit
- ‚úÖ Before updating README or documentation with completion statistics

### Quick Audit Checklist

**Lean Proof Status**:
```bash
# Count sorry statements by folder
echo "Foundations:"
grep -c sorry lean/LogicRealismTheory/Foundations/*.lean 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
echo "LogicField:"
grep -c sorry lean/LogicRealismTheory/LogicField/*.lean 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
echo "Dynamics:"
grep -c sorry lean/LogicRealismTheory/Dynamics/*.lean 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
echo "QuantumEmergence:"
grep -c sorry lean/LogicRealismTheory/QuantumEmergence/*.lean 2>/dev/null || echo "0"

# Verify builds
cd lean && lake build
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚ùå **NOT complete** if file contains ANY `sorry` statements
- ‚ùå **NOT complete** if file fails to build (`lake build` errors)
- ‚ùå **NOT complete** if any imported dependency has `sorry` statements
- ‚úÖ **Complete** ONLY if: 0 sorry + builds successfully + all dependencies complete

### Validation Rules (from Program_Auditor_Agent.md)

**Rule 1**: Stop using "complete," "validated," "finished" without verification
**Rule 2**: Cross-validate Lean proofs ‚Üî computational notebooks
**Rule 3**: Quantify with numbers, not qualitative statements
**Rule 4**: Start with what's wrong, not what works
**Rule 5**: Puncture hype with facts
**Rule 6**: Pass simulation results to LLM team before claiming victory

### Computational Validation Protocol (NEW)

**CRITICAL**: All simulation results claiming to validate LRT predictions MUST be reviewed by the multi-LLM team before making any claims.

**Mandatory team review triggers**:
- ‚úÖ Before claiming any simulation "validates" or "supports" LRT predictions
- ‚úÖ Before claiming statistical significance of results
- ‚úÖ Before reporting effect sizes as "consistent with predictions"
- ‚úÖ Before preparing results for publication or external sharing
- ‚úÖ After implementing fixes to failed simulations

**Team Review Process**:
1. **Prepare Review Package**:
   - Simulation code (notebook or script)
   - Results summary (statistical output, plots)
   - Comparison to paper's predictions (expected vs observed)
   - Known limitations and potential issues
   - Implementation details (model, sample size, controls)

2. **Submit to Multi-LLM Team**:
   ```bash
   # Use multi-LLM consultation system
   cd multi_LLM
   python enhanced_llm_bridge.py --mode consultation \
       --topic "simulation_validation" \
       --files "../notebooks/quantum_simulations/results_summary.md" \
       --output "../multi_LLM/consultation/sim_validation_YYYYMMDD.txt"
   ```

3. **Team Review Questions**:
   - Does the effect size match paper's prediction?
   - Is sample size sufficient for statistical power?
   - Are controls properly implemented?
   - Are there obvious confounds or artifacts?
   - Does the model match the theoretical framework?
   - What are alternative explanations for the results?

4. **Quality Gate**:
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT CLAIM VALIDATION** if team quality score < 0.70
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT CLAIM VALIDATION** if any team member raises critical issues
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT CLAIM VALIDATION** if effect size differs by >2x from prediction
   - ‚úÖ **MAY CLAIM VALIDATION** only if: Quality score ‚â• 0.70 + team consensus + effect size matches prediction

5. **Document Team Review**:
   - Save consultation results to `multi_LLM/consultation/`
   - Include quality score and team consensus in session log
   - Address any issues raised before making claims
   - If issues found, implement fixes and re-submit for review

**Example (Session 2.4 Lesson)**:
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: "Excellent results! Evidence for LRT prediction!" (claimed without team review)
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: "Initial signal detected (Œ≤ > 0). INCONCLUSIVE - Œ≤ 100x too large, requires investigation and team review."

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents overclaiming based on flawed models
- Catches discrepancies early (e.g., Œ≤ 100x too large)
- Ensures effect sizes are physically reasonable
- External validation before public claims
- Documents review trail for scientific credibility

### Red Flag Language

**DO NOT use without verification**:
- ‚ùå "complete" / "completed" / "finished"
- ‚ùå "validated" / "proven"
- ‚ùå "historic achievement" / "breakthrough"
- ‚ùå "X modules with 0 sorry" (without showing grep results)

**DO use**:
- ‚úÖ "X sorry statements remain in module Y" (with grep evidence)
- ‚úÖ "Module builds successfully (verified YYYY-MM-DD)"
- ‚úÖ "Module has 0 sorry but depends on incomplete module Z"
- ‚úÖ Conservative, verifiable claims with audit evidence

### Full Audit Protocol

For comprehensive audits, follow the complete protocol in `Program_Auditor_Agent.md`:
1. Lean Code Inventory (Phase 1)
2. Notebook Execution Audit (Phase 2)
3. Cross-Validation Matrix (Phase 3)
4. Empirical Testability (Phase 4)
5. Dependency Analysis (Phase 5)

**Generate audit report** using template in Program_Auditor_Agent.md

### Integration with Session Startup

**Updated Session Startup Protocol**:
1. Read CLAUDE.md (this file)
2. Read latest session file in `Session_Log/`
3. **Run quick audit checklist** (grep for sorry, verify latest build status)
4. **Update understanding** with audit results before making claims
5. Continue work with honest baseline

**Protection**: This ensures every session starts with verified facts, not assumptions.

---

## üìù Session Logging Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Sessions are tracked by sequential count, with progressive updates during active work.

**ENFORCEMENT**: You MUST update the session log progressively. Do NOT wait until user asks about it.

### Creating New Session Log

**Format**: `Session_Log/Session_X.Y.md`
- **X** = Session number (increments with each new session)
- **Y** = Update number within session (starts at 0, increments as work progresses)

**Examples**:
- `Session_Log/Session_3.0.md` (new session starts)
- `Session_Log/Session_3.1.md` (first major update)
- `Session_Log/Session_3.2.md` (second major update)
- `Session_Log/Session_3.3.md` (final update before completion)

**When to create**:
- ‚úÖ At the start of each new work session: Create `Session_X.0.md`
- ‚úÖ After completing major tasks/phases: Rename to `Session_X.Y.md` (increment Y)
- ‚úÖ Progressive updates capture evolving work in real-time
- ‚ùå Do NOT create multiple files - rename the same file with incremented Y

**Template structure**:
```markdown
# Session X.Y - [Brief Description]

**Session Number**: X.Y

2. Review: [Key documents from this session]
3. Continue: [Next major task]
```

### During Session: Progressive Updates ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY

**CRITICAL**: Update session log progressively to protect against abrupt session interruption.

**Update trigger**: After completing each major phase/task (do NOT wait for user to ask!)

**How to update**:
1. Rename current file: `Session_X.Y.md` ‚Üí `Session_X.(Y+1).md`
2. Update all sections with new progress
3. Add new phases as they complete
4. Update "Files Created/Modified" list
5. Note key achievements
6. **Commit changes** (session log updates)

**Progressive Update Protocol** (Protection Against Interruption):

‚úÖ **DO** update session log in real-time:
- After each major task completion
- After creating 2+ files
- After completing a phase/milestone
- Before any long-running operations
- At natural breakpoints in work
- **BEFORE reporting work completion to user**

‚ùå **DO NOT** wait until end of session to update
‚ùå **DO NOT** wait for user to ask "did you update the session log?"

**Update Frequency**: Every 30-60 minutes of active work, or after each deliverable

**Example progression**:
- `Session_3.0.md` - Session start (Sprint 1 begins)
- `Session_3.1.md` - After claim moderation complete [UPDATED]
- `Session_3.2.md` - After sensitivity analysis complete [UPDATED]
- `Session_3.3.md` - After table addition complete (Sprint 1 done) [UPDATED]

**Session Recovery**: If session ends abruptly, the most recent Session_X.Y.md provides complete recovery point.

**Lesson Learned (Session 7.2)**: Claude failed to update Session 7.1 ‚Üí Session 7.2 for several hours of work. User had to point it out. This is unacceptable. Update proactively!

### End of Session: Finalize

**Before ending session**:
1. ‚úÖ Make final rename to highest Y value
2. ‚úÖ Complete all sections in current session log (Session_X.Y.md)
3. ‚úÖ Ensure session log includes updated status, viability, next steps
4. ‚úÖ Archive any old/superseded session files to `archive/` if needed
5. ‚úÖ Ensure `Session_Log/` contains:
   - Session_0.0.md (historical snapshot, do not modify)
   - Current and recent session logs (Session_X.Y.md format)
   - README.md

**Result**: Sequential, versioned session history with clear progression

### Retroactive Numbering

**Previous date-based sessions** map to new numbering:
- `SESSION_2025_10_05_COMPLETE.md` = Session 1.0 (retroactive)
- `SESSION_2025_10_06_COMPLETE.md` = Session 2.0 (retroactive)
- Current session = Session 3.0 (new format begins)

---

## üîÑ Git Synchronization Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: Keep the remote repository synchronized to ensure work is backed up and accessible.

### When to Push to Remote

**Push commits to GitHub**:
- ‚úÖ After completing major phases/milestones (every Session_X.Y update)
- ‚úÖ Before ending a work session (final safety backup)
- ‚úÖ After significant breakthroughs or research results
- ‚úÖ When session log indicates completion of substantial work

### Standard Push Command

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Check sync status**: `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
   - If output shows commits, they need to be pushed

2. **Push to remote**: `git push origin main`

3. **Verify on GitHub**: Check the repository to confirm latest commits are visible

### Integration with Session Workflow

**Updated "End of Session: Finalize" checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ Make final rename to highest Y value
2. ‚úÖ Complete all sections in current session log (Session_X.Y.md)
3. ‚úÖ Ensure session log includes updated status, viability, next steps
4. ‚úÖ **Push all commits to GitHub** (`git push origin main`)
5. ‚úÖ Archive any old/superseded session files to `archive/` if needed
6. ‚úÖ Ensure `Session_Log/` contains:
   - Session_0.0.md (historical snapshot, do not modify)
   - Current and recent session logs (Session_X.Y.md format)
   - README.md

**Result**: All work is safely backed up on GitHub and available for collaboration/review.

---

## üìã Sprint Documentation Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: Sprints are tracked in the `sprints/` folder with **ONLY tracking documents**. All deliverables go to canonical locations.

### Sprint Folder Structure ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**CORRECT structure**:
```
sprints/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                                    # Sprint overview and status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_PLAN_*.md                            # Master sprint plans
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sprint_X/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md                    # ONLY tracking documents
```

**WRONG - DO NOT CREATE**:
```
sprints/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sprint_X/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team_consultations/     # ‚ùå NO - goes to multi_LLM/consultation/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/              # ‚ùå NO - goes to notebooks/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lean/                   # ‚ùå NO - goes to lean/LFT_Proofs/
```

**Rule**: Sprint folders contain **ONLY tracking markdown files**. All outputs go to canonical locations.

**Why?** Sprint folders are **pointers**, not **containers**.
- Notebooks ‚Üí `notebooks/`
- Lean files ‚Üí `lean/LogicRealismTheory/`
- Consultations ‚Üí `multi_LLM/consultation/`
- Sprint docs ‚Üí `sprints/sprint_X/` (tracking only)

### Starting a New Sprint

**When beginning a new sprint**:
1. ‚úÖ Create sprint folder: `sprints/sprint_X/`
2. ‚úÖ Initialize tracking document: `SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md` (see template below)
3. ‚ùå **DO NOT** create subfolders (team_consultations/, notebooks/, lean/)
4. ‚úÖ Update `sprints/README.md`: Mark sprint as "In Progress" in status table
5. ‚úÖ Update session log: Reference sprint start in `Session_Log/Session_X.Y.md`
6. ‚úÖ Update todo list: Add sprint deliverables as trackable tasks
7. ‚úÖ Commit initial sprint setup

### During Sprint (Daily Updates)

**CRITICAL**: Update sprint tracking document daily to protect against session interruption.

**Daily workflow**:
1. ‚úÖ Add daily log entry to `SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md` with:
   - Notebook track progress (files created in `notebooks/`)
   - Lean track progress (files created in `lean/LFT_Proofs/`)
   - Team track consultations (results in `multi_LLM/consultation/`)
   - Integration notes (how tracks informed each other)
2. ‚úÖ Create deliverables in canonical locations (NOT in sprint folder)
3. ‚úÖ Update deliverables checklist: Mark items as in progress or complete
4. ‚úÖ Commit regularly: Push progress at end of each day or major milestone
5. ‚úÖ Cross-reference: Update both sprint tracking and session log

**Team consultation workflow**:
1. Run consultation via multi-LLM bridge
2. Save results to `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_X_topic_YYYYMMDD.txt` and `.json`
3. Document in `SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md` with quality score
4. Apply insights to current development
5. Ensure quality score >0.70 for sprint success metrics

**Where deliverables go**:
- Notebooks ‚Üí `notebooks/XX_Title.ipynb`
- Lean proofs ‚Üí `lean/LogicRealismTheory/[Module]/FileName.lean`
- Consultations ‚Üí `multi_LLM/consultation/description_date.txt`
- Outputs ‚Üí `notebooks/outputs/`
- Papers ‚Üí `paper/` (with appropriate subfolders)

**Sprint tracking document**: References deliverables, does NOT contain them

### Completing a Sprint

**Before marking sprint complete**:
1. ‚úÖ Finalize tracking document: Mark all deliverables as complete with final status
2. ‚úÖ Create completion summary (optional): `SPRINT_X_COMPLETE.md` in `sprints/sprint_X/`
3. ‚úÖ Update `sprints/README.md`: Mark sprint as "Complete" with completion date
4. ‚úÖ Verify outputs: Ensure all notebooks, Lean files, consultations are in canonical locations
5. ‚úÖ Update master plan: Mark sprint complete in `SPRINT_PLAN_*.md`
6. ‚úÖ Session log: Document sprint completion with full accomplishments
7. ‚úÖ Next sprint handoff: Document what's ready, open questions, recommendations
8. ‚úÖ Commit and push: Final sprint state

### Sprint Success Metrics

**Per Sprint**:
- All team consultations score >0.70 average
- 0 `sorry` statements in Lean modules
- 100% computational validation in notebooks
- Daily integration maintained across all three tracks
- Sprint review: Team consensus "Accept" or "Minor Revision"

**Overall Program (All Sprints Complete)**:
- All critical peer review issues addressed
- Complete Lean package (~1,500 lines, fully verified)
- New notebooks (~30,000 words) validated
- Paper ready for submission
- Final team review: "Accept" or "Minor Revision" from all 3 LLMs

### Integration with Session Logs

Sprint tracking complements session logs:

- **Session Logs** (`Session_Log/`): Overall session progress, git commits, file changes, cross-session continuity
- **Sprint Tracking** (`sprints/sprint_X/`): Detailed daily sprint-specific work, team consultations, deliverable status

**Cross-referencing**:
- Session logs should reference active sprint
- Sprint tracking should note which session(s) contain the work
- Both should be updated progressively throughout the day

### Team Consultation Budget

**Total Available**: 61 consultations over 10 weeks (Sprints 6-10)
**Actual API Calls**: ~40-45 (due to 50% cache hit rate)

**Consultation allocation per sprint** (see master plan for details):
- Sprint 6: 13 consultations
- Sprint 7: 15 consultations
- Sprint 8: 10 consultations
- Sprint 9: 14 consultations
- Sprint 10: 9 consultations

**Quality requirements**:
- Each consultation must be documented with quality score
- Average consultation quality >0.70 required for sprint success
- Failed consultations (quality <0.50) should be re-run with refined prompts

## Repository Overview

This is the **Logic Realism Theory (LRT)** repository, containing mathematical derivations and computational simulations for Logic Realism Theory (LRT) - a theoretical physics framework that proposes physical reality emerges from logical filtering of information: **A = L(I)**.

---

## üîí Internal Development Work Protocol

**CRITICAL**: The repository contains internal development work that MUST NOT be referenced in public-facing code.

### approach_2_reference Directory

**Location**: `approach_2_reference/` (top-level directory)

**Purpose**: Historical internal development work containing exploratory implementations and earlier framework versions.

**Status**: INTERNAL ONLY - Not part of public codebase

### Strict Non-Reference Policy ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY

**Rules for all public-facing code**:

1. ‚úÖ **DO**: Mine good ideas and concepts from approach_2_reference
2. ‚úÖ **DO**: Reimplement concepts independently in LogicRealismTheory/
3. ‚úÖ **DO**: Use professional generic terminology when describing origins
4. ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Import any code from approach_2_reference (zero dependencies)
5. ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Reference "approach_2" or "approach 2" in any comments
6. ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Reference "approach_2" in documentation strings
7. ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Include "SOURCE: approach_2_reference/..." comments

### Acceptable Terminology (Instead of "approach_2")

When documenting origins of concepts, use:
- "from established framework"
- "from permutation-based framework"
- "from earlier theoretical work"
- "building on previous formalization"
- Generic mathematical concepts without attribution

### Verification Protocol

**Before any commit**:
```bash
# Verify zero references to approach_2
cd lean/LogicRealismTheory
grep -r "approach_2\|approach 2" . | wc -l
# Expected result: 0
```

**During code review**:
- Check for any `import` statements referencing approach_2_reference
- Check comments for "approach_2" or "approach 2"
- Check documentation strings for internal references

### Why This Matters

**Reason 1 - Professional Presentation**: Public code should present clean, self-contained implementations without internal development history.

**Reason 2 - Conceptual Independence**: LRT must stand on its own merits without relying on earlier exploratory work.

**Reason 3 - Citation Hygiene**: External reviewers should not see internal development references.

### Sprint 11 Example

**Issue Identified**: 45 references to "approach_2" found in QubitKMapping.lean, MeasurementGeometry.lean, NonUnitaryEvolution.lean

**Resolution**: All references removed and replaced with professional terminology:
- "approach_2 concepts" ‚Üí "established framework concepts"
- "SOURCE: approach_2_reference/.../File.lean" ‚Üí [removed entirely]
- "from approach_2" ‚Üí "from permutation-based framework"

**Verification**: `grep -c "approach_2\|approach 2" [files]` returned 0 for all files ‚úÖ

### Enforcement

**This protocol is MANDATORY for all sessions**. If internal references are found:
1. Identify all occurrences (grep search)
2. Replace with professional terminology
3. Verify zero references remain
4. Commit cleanup immediately
5. Document in session log

## üìÅ Repository Folder Structure Protocol

**CRITICAL**: This section defines the canonical locations for all project artifacts. Following this structure prevents fragmentation and maintains single sources of truth.

### Core Principle: **Everything Has One Home**

Each type of artifact has **exactly one** canonical location. Do NOT create alternative folders or duplicate content.

### Canonical Folder Structure

### Where Things Go: Decision Tree

#### 1. Jupyter Notebooks

**Question**: Where do notebooks go?

**Answer**: `notebooks/` **ONLY**

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Create all new notebooks in `notebooks/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use sequential numbering: `00_Title.ipynb`, `01_Title.ipynb`, etc.
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Follow V2 architecture (3-line copyright, self-contained, professional tone)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create notebooks in `approach_1` (deprecated)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create new notebook folders (`approach_2`, `version_X`, etc.)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put notebooks in `sprints/sprint_X/notebooks/` (no such folder)

**Single source of truth**: `notebooks/` is THE notebook suite.

#### 2. Lean Formal Proofs

**Question**: Where do Lean proofs go?

**Answer**: `lean/LogicRealismTheory/[MODULE]/`

**Modules**:
- `Foundations/` - Core theorems (information space, constraints, Born rule)
- `Dynamics/` - Dynamics theorems (Fisher geometry, graph Laplacian, Schr√∂dinger)
- `LogicField/` - Logic field structure
- `QuantumEmergence/` - Quantum formalism emergence
- `supporting_material/` - Exploratory work, tests, early versions

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Organize by conceptual module
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Reference canonical Logic_Realism notebook numbers in comments
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use descriptive filenames: `MaximumEntropy.lean`, `BornRule.lean`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put Lean files in `sprints/sprint_X/lean/` (no such folder)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create Lean files outside `lean/LFT_Proofs/` structure

**Example**:
```lean
-- Notebook 03: Maximum Entropy to Born Rule (Logic_Realism)
-- Computational validation: notebooks/03_Maximum_Entropy_to_Born_Rule.ipynb
```

#### 3. Team Consultations

**Question**: Where do team consultation results go?

**Answer**: `multi_LLM/consultation/` **ONLY**

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Save all team reviews/consultations to `multi_LLM/consultation/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use descriptive filenames with dates: `measurement_theory_review_20251010.txt`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Save both `.txt` (human-readable) and `.json` (structured data) if applicable
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put consultations in `sprints/sprint_X/team_consultations/` (no such folder)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Scatter consultations across multiple locations

**Single source of truth**: `multi_LLM/consultation/` is THE consultation archive.

#### 4. Sprint Documentation

**Question**: Where does sprint tracking go?

**Answer**: `sprints/sprint_X/` with **ONLY tracking documents**

**Structure** (simplified):
```
sprints/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_PLAN_*.md                # Master plans (multi-sprint scope)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sprint_X/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_X_PLAN.md            # Sprint-specific plan
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md        # Daily progress
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_X_COMPLETE.md        # Completion summary (if applicable)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.md                        # Other tracking documents
```

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Put ONLY markdown tracking documents in `sprints/sprint_X/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Put master plans (multi-sprint scope) in `sprints/` root
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Put sprint-specific plans in `sprints/sprint_X/`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create subfolders: `team_consultations/`, `notebooks/`, `lean/`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put outputs/deliverables in sprint folders

**Why no subfolders?**
- Notebooks go to `notebooks/`
- Lean files go to `lean/LFT_Proofs/`
- Consultations go to `multi_LLM/consultation/`

Sprint folders are **pointers**, not **containers**.

#### 5. Session Logs ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Question**: Where do session logs go?

**Answer**: `Session_Log/` **ONLY** (this is one of the most important folders!)

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Create `Session_X.Y.md` files in `Session_Log/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use sequential numbering with updates (X.0 ‚Üí X.1 ‚Üí X.2)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Update progressively during session (every 30-60 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Commit and push after each update (Session_X.Y increments)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put session logs anywhere else
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create date-based filenames (use Session_X.Y format)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Wait until end of session to update (update progressively!)

**Why critical?**
- Session logs are your recovery point if session ends abruptly
- They provide complete project history and context
- They're the first thing Claude reads when starting a new session
- They cross-reference all other work (sprints, notebooks, Lean proofs)

#### 6. Papers and Publications

**Question**: Where do papers go?

**Answer**: `paper/` with specific subfolders

**Structure**:
```
paper/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ It_from_Logic_Scholarly_Paper.md     # Main papers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logic_Realism_Foundational_Paper.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ figures/                             # Publication figures ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ supplementary/                       # Supporting documents
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ potential_extensions/                # Speculative research
```

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Main papers in `paper/` root
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Publication-ready figures in `paper/figures/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Supporting material in `paper/supplementary/`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put computational outputs in `paper/figures/` (those go to `notebooks/outputs/`)

#### 7. Notebook Outputs (Generated Figures/Data)

**Question**: Where do notebook-generated outputs go?

**Answer**: `notebooks/outputs/`

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: All notebook outputs go to `notebooks/outputs/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use descriptive filenames: `N3_permutohedron.png`, `fisher_metric_validation.csv`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put outputs in `paper/figures/` (those are curated publication figures)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put outputs in sprint folders

**Workflow**: Notebook generates ‚Üí `outputs/` ‚Üí Curate best for publication ‚Üí `paper/figures/`

#### 8. Scripts and Utilities

**Question**: Where do analysis scripts go?

**Answer**: `scripts/`

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Python scripts for analysis/validation go to `scripts/`
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use descriptive names: `constraint_analysis.py`, `validate_k_threshold.py`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Put inline notebook code here (keep it self-contained in notebooks)

#### 9. Archive and Historical Content

**Question**: Where does old/deprecated content go?

**Answer**: `archive/` or `*_deprecated/` folders

**Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Rename deprecated folders with `_deprecated` suffix
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Add `README_DEPRECATED.md` explaining why and pointing to replacement
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Keep for historical reference
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Delete historical work (archive it instead)

**Example**:
- `notebooks/approach_1/` ‚Üí `notebooks/approach_1_deprecated/` + README_DEPRECATED.md

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Creating Sprint Subfolders

**WRONG**:
```
sprints/sprint_8/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_8_TRACKING.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team_consultations/     # ‚ùå NO
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/              # ‚ùå NO
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lean/                   # ‚ùå NO
```

**CORRECT**:
```
sprints/sprint_8/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SPRINT_8_TRACKING.md    # ‚úÖ ONLY tracking docs
```

**Why?** Outputs go to their canonical locations, not sprint folders.

#### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Creating Alternative Notebook Folders

**WRONG**:
```
notebooks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logic_Realism/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approach_1_deprecated/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approach_2/             # ‚ùå NO
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ version_3/              # ‚ùå NO
```

**CORRECT**:
```
notebooks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logic_Realism/          # ‚úÖ ONLY active suite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ approach_1_deprecated/  # Historical reference only
```

**Why?** Single source of truth prevents fragmentation.

#### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Scattering Consultations

**WRONG**:
```
multi_LLM/consultation/review1.txt
sprints/sprint_7/team_consultations/review2.txt  # ‚ùå NO
notebooks/review3.txt              # ‚ùå NO
```

**CORRECT**:
```
multi_LLM/consultation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review1.txt             # ‚úÖ All in one place
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review2.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ review3.txt
```

**Why?** Easier to find, track, and reference.

### Quick Reference: "Where Do I Put...?"

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| New notebook | `notebooks/` | Canonical suite |
| Lean proof | `lean/LogicRealismTheory/[MODULE]/` | Organized by concept |
| Team consultation | `multi_LLM/consultation/` | Single archive |
| Sprint tracking | `sprints/sprint_X/SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md` | Tracking only |
| Sprint-specific plan | `sprints/sprint_X/SPRINT_X_PLAN.md` | Sprint-specific docs |
| Multi-sprint plan | `sprints/SPRINT_PLAN_*.md` | Master planning |
| Session log | `Session_Log/Session_X.Y.md` | Session history |

| Notebook output | `notebooks/outputs/` | Generated data/plots |
| Analysis script | `scripts/` | Utilities |
| Old/deprecated | `archive/` or `*_deprecated/` | Historical reference |

### Enforcement

**During file creation/modification**:
1. Ask: "Does this file type have a canonical location?"
2. Check this reference
3. Place file in correct location
4. Do NOT create new folders without updating CLAUDE.md

**During sprint work**:
- Sprint folder = tracking docs ONLY
- Deliverables go to canonical locations
- Reference deliverables in tracking docs (don't duplicate)

**During session work**:
- Session log = progress tracking ONLY
- Outputs go to canonical locations
- Reference outputs in session log (don't duplicate)

### Migration Notes

**If you find files in wrong locations**:
1. Identify canonical location from this guide
2. Move file to correct location
3. Update all references (Lean comments, README files, etc.)
4. Add deprecation notice if renaming folder

**Example (Sprint 8)**:
- Created notebooks in `approach_1` ‚Üí Should be in `Logic_Realism`
- Solution: Migrate to `Logic_Realism/`, deprecate `approach_1/`

---

**This structure is MANDATORY. Follow it strictly to maintain repository coherence.**

```

### Notebook Outputs
Notebooks generate files in `notebooks/approach_1/outputs/`:
- `N*_permutohedron_*.png` - Geometric visualizations
- `N*_edge_distortions.csv` - Embedding quality metrics
- `finiteK_*.png` - Quantum finite-size effects
- `*_summary.json` - Numerical results

### Publication Figures
Canonical figures are in `paper/figures/`:
- 6 publication-ready PNG files (figure1-6)
- `figure_data.json` - Source data
- `figure_specifications.md` - Technical specs

### Key Verification Tests
```python
# Core construction (notebook 03)
N = 3
assert factorial(N) == 6  # S_3 has 6 elements
assert N*(N-1)*factorial(N)//2 == 6  # Adjacent edges

# Dimensionality (notebook 04)  
N = 4
assert N - 1 == 3  # Spatial dimensions

# Reproducibility - always set seeds
import numpy as np, random
np.random.seed(42); random.seed(42)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Memory errors for N>6**: Use sampling methods or reduce trial counts
- **Missing outputs directory**: Notebooks create this automatically with `os.makedirs('./outputs', exist_ok=True)`
- **NetworkX version issues**: Ensure v2.6+ for `nx.all_topological_sorts()`
- **Slow linear extensions**: Add `limit=1000` parameter to enumeration functions

## Research Context

This repository implements active theoretical research in fundamental physics. All results are mathematical/computational demonstrations of the LFT framework. The core thesis is that physical laws (quantum mechanics, spacetime geometry, gravity) can be derived rather than postulated, emerging from logical consistency requirements on an information space.

**Important**: After each session, ensure the current session log (Session_X.Y.md) is complete with updated status, accomplishments, viability assessments, and next steps. Also update relevant README files as needed.
- keep hyperbole to a minimum
- always keep the tone professional
- track sprints in the sprints root folder
- validate all claims tied to amount of sorrys in Lean proofs
- validate all notebooks, Lean proofs, code, etc with the multi-LLM team
- Always add key insights gained and lessons learn for each session closeout
- all sprints documentation goes into the sprints folder
- 1 priority- discuss emergence framework artifact in the theory folder
- always follow best CI/CD practices

## üî¨ Lean 4 Proof Development Best Practices

**Context**: Lessons learned from completing QubitKMapping and Energy modules (Session 2.12+)

### Key Insights

#### 1. **Physical Axioms vs Mathematical Theorems**

**Principle**: Some physical properties are fundamental postulates, not provable from mathematical structure alone.

**Examples**:
- **Energy additivity** (E_total = E‚ÇÅ + E‚ÇÇ for independent systems):
  - CANNOT be proven: `(p‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇ)¬≤/(2(m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ)) ‚â† p‚ÇÅ¬≤/(2m‚ÇÅ) + p‚ÇÇ¬≤/(2m‚ÇÇ)` in general
  - IS a fundamental physical principle (analogous to entropy extensivity)
  - **Solution**: Axiomatize with comprehensive documentation explaining why

- **Binary entropy bound** (Shannon's theorem: H(p, 1-p) ‚â§ log 2):
  - Well-established result requiring calculus infrastructure
  - **Solution**: Axiomatize with proof sketch and reference

**When to axiomatize**:
- ‚úÖ Well-established results requiring infrastructure we don't have
- ‚úÖ Physical principles beyond mathematical structure alone
- ‚úÖ Always include comprehensive documentation:
  - Why it's an axiom (not provable with current infrastructure)
  - Proof sketch or reference
  - Physical/mathematical justification
  - Status note

**Pattern** (from QubitKMapping.lean):
```lean
axiom binary_entropy_bound (p q : ‚Ñù) (h_norm : p + q = 1)
    (hp_pos : 0 < p) (hq_pos : 0 < q) (hp_le : p ‚â§ 1) (hq_le : q ‚â§ 1) :
  -(p * Real.log p + q * Real.log q) ‚â§ Real.log 2

/-!
Comprehensive doc block explaining:
- Mathematical statement
- Proof sketch (derivatives, concavity argument)
- Reference (Shannon 1948)
- Status (well-established, axiomatized due to infrastructure)
-/
```

#### 2. **field_simp is Powerful for Division Algebra**

**Context**: Extensivity proof in Energy.lean initially attempted with manual calc chains, causing errors.

**Solution**: Use `field_simp` with explicit nonzero hypotheses:

```lean
have h_N_ne_zero : (N : ‚Ñù) ‚â† 0 := ne_of_gt h_N_pos
have h_m_ne_zero : H_struct.m ‚â† 0 := ne_of_gt H_struct.positive_mass

rw [H_struct.hamiltonian_def]
field_simp [h_N_ne_zero, h_m_ne_zero]
-- Proof complete! (no need for additional ring tactic)
```

**Why this works**:
- `field_simp` clears all fractions using nonzero hypotheses
- Automatically handles division algebra without manual steps
- Often completes proofs without needing `ring` afterward

**When to use**:
- ‚úÖ Proving equalities involving division
- ‚úÖ When you have explicit nonzero hypotheses
- ‚úÖ Alternative to manual `div_mul_eq_mul_div`, `mul_div_mul_right` chains

#### 3. **Edit Tool Cache Issues on Windows/OneDrive**

**Problem**: Edit tool repeatedly fails with "File has been unexpectedly modified" even when git shows no changes.

**Root cause**: Likely OneDrive sync or file system cache issues causing apparent modifications.

**Solution**: Use Python/bash scripts for edits instead:

```python
# Read file
with open('Energy.lean', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Make replacements
content = content.replace(old_string, new_string)

# Write back
with open('Energy.lean', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

**When to use**:
- ‚úÖ After 2-3 consecutive Edit tool failures
- ‚úÖ When working with files in OneDrive-synced directories
- ‚úÖ For complex multi-part edits

#### 4. **Complex Number Type Coercion Pattern**

**Context**: Proving properties about `normSq (1/sqrt 2 : ‚ÑÇ) = 1/2`.

**Pattern**:
```lean
have h_normsq : normSq (1/sqrt 2 : ‚ÑÇ) = 1/2 := by
  rw [normSq_div, normSq_one, normSq_ofReal]
  simp  -- Uses sq_sqrt automatically
```

**Key lemmas**:
- `normSq_div`: `normSq (a/b) = normSq a / normSq b`
- `normSq_one`: `normSq 1 = 1`
- `normSq_ofReal`: `normSq (x : ‚ÑÇ) = x¬≤` for real x
- `Real.sq_sqrt`: `sqrt(x)¬≤ = x` for x ‚â• 0

**When needed**: Working with quantum states as complex amplitudes

#### 5. **Proof Strategy: Try Simple First**

**Workflow**:
1. **Try automated tactics first**: `simp`, `ring`, `field_simp`, `norm_num`
2. **If that fails, add structure**: `calc` chains, intermediate `have` statements
3. **Only then use manual lemmas**: `div_mul_eq_mul_div`, `mul_pow`, etc.
4. **Last resort**: Axiomatize with documentation

**Example (extensivity proof evolution)**:
- ‚ùå Attempt 1: Manual `calc` chain with `mul_div_mul_right` ‚Üí Term ordering errors
- ‚ùå Attempt 2: `calc` with `ring` at each step ‚Üí "No goals" error
- ‚úÖ Success: Simple `field_simp` with nonzero hypotheses ‚Üí Complete

**Lesson**: Simpler is often better. Lean's automation is powerful.

#### 6. **Documentation Standards for Axioms**

**Minimum requirements** for any `axiom` or `sorry` with documentation:

1. **Status line**: Clearly state it's an axiom and why
2. **Mathematical statement**: What exactly is being assumed
3. **Justification**: Why can't it be proven / why is it a physical principle
4. **Reference**: Citation if it's a known result
5. **Proof sketch** (if applicable): How it would be proven with full infrastructure

**Example template**:
```lean
/-!
PHYSICAL AXIOM: [Property Name]

[Why it cannot be mathematically proven]

However, [property] is a FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PRINCIPLE because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

Reference: [Citation]

Status: [Well-established / Requires physical assumptions / etc.]
-/
axiom property_name [parameters] : [statement]
```

#### 7. **User's "no sorrys if we can help it" Principle**

**Directive**: Eliminate ALL sorry statements if possible, not leave them incomplete.

**Options when facing a sorry**:
1. ‚úÖ **Prove it** using available tactics/lemmas
2. ‚úÖ **Axiomatize it** with comprehensive documentation
3. ‚ùå **Leave it as sorry** without explanation

**This session's achievement**:
- QubitKMapping.lean: **0 sorry** (all proofs complete or documented axioms)
- Energy.lean: **1 documented axiom** (additivity) + **1 proven** (extensivity)

### Summary: Process Improvements Captured

1. ‚úÖ Axiomatize well-established results with full documentation
2. ‚úÖ Use `field_simp` for division algebra proofs
3. ‚úÖ Bypass Edit tool cache issues with Python scripts
4. ‚úÖ Try simple tactics before complex manual proofs
5. ‚úÖ Document axioms thoroughly (status, justification, reference)
6. ‚úÖ Eliminate sorrys through proof or documented axiomatization

**Impact**: Professional, scientifically rigorous formal proofs that clearly distinguish mathematical theorems from physical postulates.
