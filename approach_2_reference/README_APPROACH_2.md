# Approach 2: Physical Logic Framework (Archive)

**Status**: Complete (140 axioms, 0 sorry, fully validated)
**Date Archived**: October 25, 2025
**Role**: Computational validation reference for Logic Realism Theory

## Purpose of This Archive

Approach 2 (Physical Logic Framework) served as the **prototype** that proved the core concepts are computationally viable. All work from Approach 2 is archived here as a complete reference for Logic Realism Theory (LRT) development.

**Relationship**:
- **Approach 2 = Prototype**: 140 axioms, 25 notebooks, comprehensive computational exploration
- **LRT = Production**: 5 axioms, 9 notebooks, clean philosophical framing

Logic Realism Theory is **not** an extension of Approach 2—it's a fresh implementation with lessons learned applied from the start.

- **Indistinguishability/** (1 file): Symmetry and indistinguishability
- **LogicRealism/** (1 file): Unified framework

**Axiom Status**: 140 axioms (fully intentional, all validated computationally)

### 2. Computational Notebooks (`notebooks/Logic_Realism/`)

**25 Jupyter notebooks** (~80,000 words) with complete computational exploration:

**Foundation** (00-02):
- Core thesis, information space, logical operators

**Worked Examples** (03-05):
- N=3,4 complete analyses with permutohedron geometry

### 4. Session Logs (`sessions/`)

**Complete development history** (Sessions 1-16):
- Session_0.0.md - Initial setup
- Session_1-15.md - Development progression
- Session_16.0.md - LRT planning and analysis

### 5. Root Documentation (`root_docs/`)

**20+ markdown files** including:

## Key Achievements (Approach 2)

### Mathematical Results

1. **K(N) = N-2 Constraint Threshold**
   - Formally proved in Lean 4
   - Computationally validated for N=3,4,5,6

   - Embedding quality metrics

3. **Graph Laplacian → Schrödinger Equation**
   - Continuous limit derivation
   - Energy spectrum emergence

4. **Born Rule from Maximum Entropy**
   - Formal proof (with caveats)
   - Computational validation

5. **Quantum Measurement**
   - Constraint accumulation mechanism
   - Partial vs. full constraint effects

### Technical Accomplishments

- **25 notebooks**: All execute without error
- **~80,000 words**: Comprehensive documentation
- **Multi-LLM validation**: Team consultations throughout

## Lessons Learned

(See `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` for detailed analysis)

**Key insights applied to LRT**:

1. **Axiom Minimalism**: 140 axioms → 5 axioms (96% reduction)
2. **Philosophical Clarity**: Start with A = L(I) principle, not S_N hierarchy
3. **Notebook Focus**: 25 notebooks → 9 focused derivations (64% reduction)
4. **Single Paper**: Multiple papers → ONE north star document
5. **Program Auditor**: Essential for preventing overclaiming

## How LRT Uses This Archive

**Reference for Computational Validation**:
- LRT notebooks cite Approach 2 results
- S_N hierarchy remains as concrete realization (Notebook 09)
- Geometric visualizations reference Approach 2 outputs

**What LRT Does NOT Do**:
- Duplicate computational exploration
- Re-prove S_N-specific results
- Re-create extensive parameter studies

**Strategy**: Cite Approach 2, don't replicate it.
