## Daily Progress Log

### 2025-10-30 (Planning + Track 1 Execution)

**Session**: Session 5.4+

**Work Done**:

**Planning Phase**:
- Created comprehensive Sprint 8 plan with 3 tracks

- Identified risk areas and mitigation strategies
- Set up tracking document
- Updated sprints/README.md (Sprint 7 complete, Sprint 8 active)

**Track 1 Execution** ‚úÖ COMPLETE:
- Updated Abstract: Added variational optimization framing, specified T2/T1 ‚âà 0.81, Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23
- Rewrote Section 1.3: Changed from "First-Principles Prediction" to "Testable Hypothesis from Variational Optimization"

  - Track 1: 12-15 hours
  - Track 2: 8-10 hours
  - Track 3: 6-8 hours

**Complexity**: High (requires careful framing and consistency)
**Risk Level**: Medium (clear plan, but many files to update)

**Success Metrics**:
- All "first-principles derivation" claims removed/reframed: YES/NO
- Variational derivation clearly documented: YES/NO
- Notebook 07 created and executes: YES/NO
- Consistency across all documents: YES/NO
- Multi-LLM review quality ‚â• 0.70: YES/NO

## Issues and Blockers

**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Token limits during paper review (Mitigation: 3-track approach)
- Inconsistencies across many documents (Mitigation: Track 3 systematic check)
- Multi-LLM consultations not available (Mitigation: Proceed with best judgment)

## Key Insights (To Be Updated During Sprint)

**Framing principles**:
- Be explicit about assumptions
- Use "theoretically motivated" not "first-principles"
- Emphasize testability
- Acknowledge environmental parameters
- Present as improvement over phenomenology, not pure derivation

**Lessons learned**: (to be filled in during work)

## Team Consultation History

**No consultations yet** (sprint just planned)

---

## Notes

**Critical reminders**:
1. Every "first-principles" claim must be reviewed
2. Every occurrence of Œ∑ ‚àà [0.11, 0.43] must be updated to Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23
3. Every occurrence of T2/T1 ‚âà 0.7-0.9 must be updated to T2/T1 ‚âà 0.81
4. Assumptions must be explicitly listed in Section 6.3.6
5. Notebook 07 copyright header required

**Philosophy**: Honest science passes review. Overclaiming gets rejected.

**Sprint 8 Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE, READY TO EXECUTE
