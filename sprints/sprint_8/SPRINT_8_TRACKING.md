  - Track 1: 12-15 hours
  - Track 2: 8-10 hours
  - Track 3: 6-8 hours

**Complexity**: High (requires careful framing and consistency)
**Risk Level**: Medium (clear plan, but many files to update)

**Success Metrics**:

- Variational derivation clearly documented: YES/NO
- Notebook 07 created and executes: YES/NO
- Consistency across all documents: YES/NO

## Issues and Blockers

**Current Issues**: None

**Potential Blockers**:
- Token limits during paper review (Mitigation: 3-track approach)
- Inconsistencies across many documents (Mitigation: Track 3 systematic check)
- Multi-LLM consultations not available (Mitigation: Proceed with best judgment)

## Key Insights (To Be Updated During Sprint)

**Framing principles**:
- Be explicit about assumptions
- Use "theoretically motivated" not "first-principles"
- Emphasize testability
- Acknowledge environmental parameters
- Present as improvement over phenomenology, not pure derivation

**Lessons learned**: (to be filled in during work)

---

## Team Consultation History

**No consultations yet** (sprint just planned)

---

## Notes

**Critical reminders**:
1. Every "first-principles" claim must be reviewed
2. Every occurrence of η ∈ [0.11, 0.43] must be updated to η ≈ 0.23
3. Every occurrence of T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 must be updated to T2/T1 ≈ 0.81
4. Assumptions must be explicitly listed in Section 6.3.6
5. Notebook 07 copyright header required

**Philosophy**: Honest science passes review. Overclaiming gets rejected.

**Sprint 8 Status**: ✅ ALL TRACKS COMPLETE - READY TO COMMIT AND PUSH
