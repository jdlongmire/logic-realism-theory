## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Mathlib Integration Complexity

**Description**: Stone's theorem and entropy definitions may require extensive Mathlib imports

**Mitigation**:
- Start with abstract definitions if Mathlib too complex
- Use sorry strategically for Mathlib-dependent proofs
- Document what's needed from Mathlib
- Alternative: Define simplified versions first

### Risk 2: Proof Difficulty

**Description**: Derivations may be harder to prove formally than expected

**Mitigation**:
- Break into smaller lemmas
- Use computational notebooks to validate approach
- Consult team (multi-LLM) for proof strategies
- Accept strategic sorry if blocked (document thoroughly)

### Risk 3: Scope Creep

**Description**: Temptation to add more derivations (mass, gravity, etc.)

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on primary deliverables (Tracks 1-3)
- Defer additional derivations to Sprint 3
- Optional tracks (4-5) can be deferred
- Stick to sprint plan

---

## Team Consultation Budget

**Allocated**: 3-5 consultations for Sprint 2

**Planned Uses**:
1. Time emergence proof strategy (Track 1)
2. Energy derivation review (Track 2)
3. Russell paradox formalization (Track 3)
4. (Optional) Overall sprint review

**Quality Requirement**: Average score >0.70
