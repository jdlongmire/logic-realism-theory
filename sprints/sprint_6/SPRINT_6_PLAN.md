# Sprint 6: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulation

**Sprint Number**: 6
**Start Date**: 2025-10-30
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (estimated)
**GitHub Issue**: [#2 - don't forget Lagrangian and Hamiltonian](https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory/issues/2)

## Sprint Goal

Derive the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms from LRT first principles (A = L(I)), connecting constraint dynamics to variational mechanics and establishing the theoretical foundation for classical and quantum mechanics within LRT.

---

## Background

### Current State

LRT currently has:
- ✅ **Energy derivation**: From Spohn's inequality → `E ∝ ΔS` ([Energy.lean](../../lean/LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/Energy.lean))
- ✅ **Time evolution**: From Stone's theorem → `U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)` ([TimeEmergence.lean](../../lean/LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean))
- ✅ **Born rule**: From MaxEnt + 3FLL → `p(x) = |⟨x|ψ⟩|²`

**Gap**: The **Lagrangian (L = T - V)** and **Hamiltonian (H = T + V)** formalisms are not derived from first principles. They are currently assumed as structures in the existing derivations.

### Why This Matters

1. **Theoretical Completeness**: LRT claims to derive physics from logic - should derive variational formalism too
2. **Classical-Quantum Bridge**: Canonical quantization requires Hamiltonian formalism
3. **Conservation Laws**: Noether's theorem connects symmetries to conserved quantities via Lagrangian
4. **Predictive Power**: Least action principle is fundamental to physics - should emerge from LRT

## Sprint Objectives

### Primary Deliverables

1. **Lagrangian Derivation** (from constraint minimization)
   - Define action `S[path]` in terms of constraint violation
   - Prove least action = least logical inconsistency
   - Derive Euler-Lagrange equations

2. **Hamiltonian Derivation** (via Legendre transform)
   - Perform Legendre transform: `H = p·∂L/∂p - L`
   - Show Hamiltonian = total constraint cost (kinetic + potential)
   - Connect to existing energy derivation (Spohn)

3. **Lean Formalization**
   - Create `LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/Lagrangian.lean`
   - Create `LogicRealismTheory/Derivations/Hamiltonian.lean`
   - 0 sorry statements (fully proven)
   - Integration with Energy.lean and TimeEmergence.lean

4. **Theoretical Documentation**
   - Update Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md with Lagrangian/Hamiltonian sections
   - Conceptual explanation of derivation path
   - Connection to variational principles

### Secondary Deliverables

5. **Canonical Quantization** (stretch goal)
   - Derive commutation relations from constraint structure
   - Show `[x, p] = iℏ` emerges from logical constraint algebra
   - Connect to Born rule derivation

6. **Noether's Theorem** (stretch goal)
   - Derive energy conservation from time translation symmetry
   - Connect to Identity constraint (logical invariance)

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Kinetic Energy from State Space Dynamics

**Hypothesis**: Kinetic energy represents the "cost" of exploring state space.

**Derivation**:
1. State space traversal requires transitions between configurations
2. Rate of traversal → velocity in configuration space
3. "Inertia" emerges from resistance to constraint violation
4. `T ∝ (dq/dt)²` → kinetic term

**Lean Module**: `Lagrangian.lean` (kinetic section)

### Phase 2: Potential Energy from Constraint Violations

**Hypothesis**: Potential energy represents the "penalty" for being in high-constraint-violation states.

**Derivation**:
1. States with high `K` (constraint threshold) are "energetically unfavorable"
2. `V(q) ∝ K(q)` → constraint-based potential
3. Connection to Spohn's inequality (entropy change)
4. `V` creates "force" toward low-constraint states

**Lean Module**: `Lagrangian.lean` (potential section)

### Phase 3: Lagrangian from Variational Principle

**Hypothesis**: Least action = paths of maximal logical consistency.

**Derivation**:
1. Define action: `S = ∫ (T - V) dt`
2. `T - V` = (exploration rate) - (constraint penalty)
3. Extremize `S` → Euler-Lagrange equations
4. Physical paths minimize constraint violation over time

**Lean Module**: `Lagrangian.lean` (variational principle)

### Phase 4: Hamiltonian via Legendre Transform

**Hypothesis**: Hamiltonian = total "cost of being" in phase space.

**Derivation**:
1. Define momentum: `p = ∂L/∂(dq/dt)`
2. Legendre transform: `H(q, p) = p·(dq/dt) - L`
3. `H = T + V` = total constraint cost
4. Hamilton's equations from variational principle

**Lean Module**: `Hamiltonian.lean`

### Phase 5: Integration with Existing Work

**Connect to**:
- **Energy.lean**: Hamiltonian energy matches Spohn-derived energy
- **TimeEmergence.lean**: `H` as generator of time evolution (Stone's theorem)
- **Born rule**: Canonical quantization → quantum formalism

**Verification**:
- Show consistency across all modules
- No circular dependencies
- All axioms documented in AXIOMS.md

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Circular Reasoning
**Issue**: Deriving Lagrangian might presuppose energy, which was derived using Hamiltonian structure.

**Mitigation**:
- Carefully track dependency chain
- Use only constraint violation primitives (K, state space)
- Verify no circular imports in Lean

### Risk 2: Too Many Axioms
**Issue**: Derivation might require new physical postulates.

**Mitigation**:
- Minimize axioms (target: 0 new axioms)
- Use only: constraint violation, state space dynamics, Spohn's inequality
- Document any new axioms with full justification

### Risk 3: Incompatibility with Existing Work
**Issue**: New derivation might contradict Energy.lean or TimeEmergence.lean.

**Mitigation**:
- Continuous cross-checking during development
- Build verification tests
- Multi-LLM review of consistency
