## Deliverables Checklist

### Phase 1: Kinetic Energy (T)
- [ ] Derive kinetic energy from state space traversal rate
- [ ] Formalize in Lagrangian.lean (kinetic section)
- [ ] Prove `T ‚àù (dq/dt)¬≤` from constraint dynamics
- [ ] Document derivation path

### Phase 2: Potential Energy (V)
- [ ] Derive potential from constraint violation penalty
- [ ] Formalize in Lagrangian.lean (potential section)
- [ ] Connect `V(q) ‚àù K(q)` to Spohn's inequality
- [ ] Prove force emerges as gradient of constraints

### Phase 3: Lagrangian Formulation
- [ ] Define action `S = ‚à´ (T - V) dt` from constraint principles
- [ ] Derive Euler-Lagrange equations
- [ ] Prove least action = minimal constraint violation
- [ ] Formalize variational principle in Lagrangian.lean

### Phase 4: Hamiltonian Formulation
- [ ] Perform Legendre transform: `H = p¬∑‚àÇL/‚àÇ(dq/dt) - L`
- [ ] Derive Hamilton's equations
- [ ] Prove `H = T + V` = total constraint cost
- [ ] Create Hamiltonian.lean module

### Phase 5: Integration & Verification
- [ ] Connect Hamiltonian to Energy.lean (Spohn derivation)
- [ ] Verify consistency with TimeEmergence.lean (Stone's theorem)
- [ ] Update AXIOMS.md (axiom count, new modules)
- [ ] Update LogicRealismTheory.lean (add imports)
- [ ] Full build verification (0 errors, 0 sorry)

### Documentation
- [ ] Add Lagrangian/Hamiltonian section to Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md
- [ ] Create conceptual explanation document
- [ ] Update GitHub issue #2 with results
- [ ] Session log documentation

### Multi-LLM Review
- [ ] Pre-sprint: Review derivation approach
- [ ] Mid-sprint: Review Lagrangian.lean formalization
- [ ] Post-sprint: Final verification (quality ‚â•0.70)

## Daily Progress Log

### 2025-10-30 (Sprint Planning)

**Session**: 5.3 (measurement refactoring continuation)

**Work Done**:
- Created Sprint 6 plan and tracking documents
- Defined 5-phase approach (kinetic, potential, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, integration)
- Set success criteria and timeline (2-3 weeks)
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies

**Deliverables**:
- `sprints/sprint_6/SPRINT_6_PLAN.md` (comprehensive sprint plan)
- `sprints/sprint_6/SPRINT_6_TRACKING.md` (this file)

**Next Steps**:
- Update sprints/README.md to include Sprint 6
- Multi-LLM pre-sprint review of derivation approach
- Begin Phase 1 (kinetic energy derivation)

**Status**: Planning complete, ready to start execution

## Sprint Metrics

**Target Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Estimated Hours**: 40-60 hours (with AI assistance)
**Complexity**: Moderate
**Risk Level**: Medium (circular reasoning, axiom count)

**Success Metrics**:
- Lagrangian and Hamiltonian derived: YES/NO
- Lean formalization complete (0 sorry): YES/NO
- Integration verified: YES/NO
- Multi-LLM quality score: ‚â•0.70

## Issues and Blockers

**Current Issues**: None (sprint not yet started)

**Potential Blockers**:
- Circular dependency risk (energy ‚Üî Hamiltonian)
- Need for new axioms (target: 0 new)
- Integration complexity with existing modules

**Mitigation**:
- Careful dependency tracking in Lean
- Use only constraint primitives (K, state space)
- Continuous cross-checking during development

## Notes

**Context**: This sprint addresses GitHub issue #2, which was created Oct 29, 2025 but had no description. Description added Oct 30, 2025 during Session 5.3.

**Motivation**: Complete the classical mechanics foundation within LRT, enabling:
- Theoretical completeness (derive variational formalism)
- Canonical quantization framework
- Noether's theorem (conservation laws)
- Deeper connection to existing energy/time derivations

**Integration Points**:
- Energy.lean (Spohn's inequality)
- TimeEmergence.lean (Stone's theorem)
- Future: Canonical quantization, Noether's theorem

**Status**: Sprint plan complete, awaiting start signal from user.
