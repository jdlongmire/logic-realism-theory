# Sprint 5 Tracking: Rigorous Derivations

**Sprint**: 5
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: October 28, 2025
**Target Completion**: November 25, 2025

## Daily Log

### October 28, 2025 - Sprint Initialization

**Session**: 3.11 (continued)

**Activities**:
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with Research Philosophy: Collaborative Refinement
- ✅ Created Sprint 5 plan (`SPRINT_5_PLAN.md`)
- ✅ Created Sprint 5 tracking document
- ⏳ Begin energy derivation circularity analysis

**Context**:
Received high-quality peer review identifying 4 critical logical issues:
1. **Circular energy derivation** (Section 3.4) - CRITICAL
2. **η parameter not derived** (Section 5.1.2) - CRITICAL
3. **Pre-mathematical tension** (Section 2.3.1) - MODERATE
4. **Lean formalization overstated** (Section 9.1) - MODERATE

**Response Strategy**:
Following new research philosophy: Solve problems through rigorous derivation, don't weaken claims.
Core thesis A = L(I) is non-negotiable unless proven logically impossible.

**Next Steps**:
- Read current Section 3.4 to identify exact circularity point
- Attempt Approach 1: Information erasure → energy derivation
- Fix Lean formalization claims (Section 9.1)

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Rigorous Derivation Approach
**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Decision**: Solve critical issues through first-principles derivations, not claim weakening
**Rationale**: Peer review identified real logical gaps. Core thesis non-negotiable. Collaborative refinement philosophy.
**Impact**: Sprint 5 focuses on rigorous mathematical/logical work

### Decision 2: Three-Approach Parallel Strategy
**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Decision**: Attempt multiple approaches for each critical issue
**Rationale**: If one approach fails, others may succeed
**Impact**: More work, higher probability of success

---

## Notes

**Sprint Philosophy**:
- Solve problems, don't retreat
- Core thesis A = L(I) is non-negotiable
- Obstacles are opportunities for deeper understanding
- Only weaken claims if: logically impossible, empirically falsified, or all approaches exhausted

**Critical Path**: Track 1 (Energy Derivation)
- Must resolve circularity before paper can claim to "derive" energy
- Reviewer's criticism is valid and must be addressed rigorously
