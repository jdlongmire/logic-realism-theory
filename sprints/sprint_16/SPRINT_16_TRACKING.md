## Daily Log

### Week 0: Pre-Sprint Planning

**2025-11-05**:
- ✅ Sprint 16 plan created (SPRINT_16_PLAN.md, 28 tasks)
- ✅ V&V report completed (TOP_4_VV_REPORT.md, 16,000 words)
- ✅ Tracking document initialized
- 🔴 Sprint not yet started (awaiting user approval)

---

## Session Cross-Reference

**Planning Session**: Session 11.0 (2025-11-05)
- Created Sprint 16 plan
- Completed V&V report
- Renamed T2-T1 to Path_5_T2-T1

**Execution Sessions**: TBD (will be created as sprint progresses)

---

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Decisions**:
1. Sprint 16 focuses on predictions (parallel to Lean work in Sprints 13-15)
2. Gate criteria MUST pass before experimental outreach
3. S_EM(θ) derivation is highest priority (affects 3/4 paths)
4. Path 2 prioritized for immediate outreach (1-2 month timeline)

**Open Questions**:
- Should we start Sprint 16 before completing Sprints 13-15 (Lean work)?
- Do we have QuTiP expertise for complex simulations (Path 4)?
- Should we consult experimental colleagues on pitch materials before finalizing?

**Tracking Status**: 🟡 INITIALIZED
**Next Update**: After Week 1 completion or significant progress
**Sprint Lead**: TBD
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-05
