# Sprint 3: Additional Derivations (Mass, Gravity) - DEFERRED

**Sprint**: 3
**Status**: ⏸️ DEFERRED/NEVER STARTED
**Originally Planned**: October 2025 (Session 2.1)
**Priority**: Low (deferred indefinitely)

---

## Why Sprint 3 Was Skipped

**Original Intent** (from Session_Log/Session_2.1.md):
- Additional derivations: mass, gravity, etc.
- Follow-on work after Sprint 2

**What Happened**:
- Sprint 3 was planned but never executed
- Research priorities shifted to more urgent issues:
  - Sprint 4: Peer Review Response (major revisions)
  - Sprint 7: Derive η from First Principles (critical scientific integrity issue)
  - Sprint 8: Honest Framing Integration
- Additional derivations deemed lower priority than core theory validation

**Current Status**:
- Sprint 3 objectives remain valid long-term research goals
- No specific timeline for execution
- May be revisited after core theory is fully validated

---

## Original Sprint 3 Objectives (Deferred)

From Session 2.1 notes:
1. **Mass Derivation**: Derive mass from constraint dynamics
2. **Gravity Derivation**: Connect gravitational effects to information geometry
3. **Additional Physical Quantities**: Extend framework to other observables

## Why This Directory Exists

This directory was created on 2025-11-03 during sprint renumbering cleanup to:
1. Document that Sprint 3 was planned but never started
2. Explain the gap in sprint numbering (Sprint 1, 2, [3 skipped], 4, 5, ...)
3. Provide historical context for future researchers

## Sprint Numbering After Renumbering

**Sequential Sprints**:
1. Sprint 1: ✅ Complete (Lean Operators & First Notebook)
2. Sprint 2: ✅ Complete (details in sprint_2/)
3. **Sprint 3**: ⏸️ DEFERRED (this document)
4. Sprint 4: ⏸️ On Hold (Peer Review Response)
5. Sprint 5: ✅ Complete (details in sprint_5/)
6. Sprint 6: 🟡 Deferred (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian)
7. Sprint 7: ✅ Complete (η Derivation)
8. Sprint 8: ✅ Complete (Honest Framing)
9. Sprint 9: 🟡 Planning (Lean Proof Cleanup)
10. Sprint 10: 🟡 Planning (K-Theory Integration)

## Future Work

If/when Sprint 3 objectives are revisited, they may be:
- Incorporated into a future sprint with updated numbering
- Split across multiple focused sprints
- Integrated with experimental validation efforts

For now, Sprint 3 remains a placeholder documenting deferred research goals.
