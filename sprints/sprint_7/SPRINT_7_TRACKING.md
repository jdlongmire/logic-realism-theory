# Sprint 7 Tracking: Derive η from First Principles (CRITICAL)

**Sprint**: 7
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Ready to Start
**Started**: 2025-10-30 (Sprint Planning)
**Priority**: URGENT (supersedes all other sprints)
**GitHub Issue**: TBD

---

## Sprint Goal

Derive the Excluded Middle coupling parameter η from LRT first principles without fitting to observational data, resolving the circular reasoning issue in the T2/T1 prediction.

---

## Context: Critical Issue Identified

**Reddit Critique** (2025-10-30):
> "The 'model' claims η exists and T2/T1 = 1/(1+η), then finds η via model fitting such that T2/T1 = 0.7-0.9. The 'model' does not derive η from first principles (6.3.5, Ongoing Work) and thus does not predict T2/T1. Why are you lying with the claim that LRT predicts these range of values?"

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Paper Section 6.3.5 explicitly admits η is "phenomenological"
- ✅ Lean code contains no η derivation
- ✅ Notebook 05 claims "from first principles" but uses fitted η
- ✅ Fisher information attempt yielded η ≈ 0.01 (wrong by factor ~20)

**Conclusion**: Commenter is correct. This is circular reasoning and must be fixed.

## Daily Progress Log

### 2025-10-30 (Sprint Planning)

**Session**: 5.3 (measurement refactoring + critical pivot)

**Critical Issue Identified**:
- Reddit commenter pointed out circular reasoning in T2/T1 prediction
- User directive: "well. sounds like that is a more urgent priority for a sprint"
- Verification completed: η is indeed phenomenological, not derived
- User confirmed: "yes" to creating Sprint 7

**Work Done**:
- Created Sprint 7 comprehensive plan (5 phases)
- Defined two acceptable outcomes: Success (derive η) OR Failure (acknowledge limitation)
- Identified four derivation approaches: constraint violation, thermodynamic cost, Fisher geometry, timescale ratio
- Set success criteria: Scientific integrity restored regardless of outcome

**Deliverables**:
- `sprints/sprint_7/SPRINT_7_PLAN.md` (comprehensive sprint plan)
- `sprints/sprint_7/SPRINT_7_TRACKING.md` (this file)

**Next Steps**:
- Update sprints/README.md to add Sprint 7 as CRITICAL priority
- Update Session 5.3 to document critical pivot
- Multi-LLM pre-sprint consultation: Review derivation approaches
- Begin Phase 1: Constraint violation rate analysis

**Status**: Planning complete, ready to start execution

### 2025-10-30 (Multi-LLM Consultation + Phase 1 Complete)

**Session**: 5.4

**Multi-LLM Pre-Sprint Consultation** ✅:
- Consulted Grok-3, GPT-4, Gemini-2.0 on all four derivation approaches
- Quality scores: Grok 0.70 (✅), Gemini 0.55, ChatGPT 0.296
- Average: 0.515 (⚠️ below 0.70 threshold, but Grok individually meets)
- **Team consensus**: Hybrid Thermodynamic + Constraint Violation (Approaches 2+1)
- **Rankings**: Top 2 approaches: Thermodynamic Cost, Constraint Violation Rate
- **CRITICAL RED FLAG IDENTIFIED**: Both Grok and Gemini flagged environmental dependence
  - "If η requires temperature T or bath parameters, cannot be derived purely from LRT axioms"
  - May be fundamentally phenomenological

**Phase 1: Constraint Violation Rate Analysis** ✅ COMPLETE:
- Defined K_EM(|ψ⟩) mathematically (purity-based: K_EM = -|α|² ln|α|² - |β|² ln|β|²)
- Established constraint enforcement: dK_EM/dt = -γ_EM K_EM
- Connected to Landauer's principle: γ_EM = kT ln 2 / ℏ
- **Derived**: Γ_φ = kT ln 2 / ℏ (phase decoherence rate)
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: ⚠️ **Environmental dependence CONFIRMED**
  - Γ_φ explicitly depends on T (temperature) - NOT in LRT axioms
  - Γ_1 also requires bath coupling, spectral density
  - η = Γ_φ / Γ_1 - 1 appears system-dependent
- **Status**: Consultation red flag CONFIRMED - η likely phenomenological

**Files Created**:
- `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_7_eta_derivation_presprint_brief.md`
- `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_7_focused_query.txt`
- `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_7_eta_derivation_presprint_results_FINAL_20251030.json`
- `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_7_consultation_analysis.md`
- `sprints/sprint_7/Phase1_Constraint_Violation_Analysis.md`

**Next Phase**:
- Phase 2: Attempt to derive Γ_1 from constraint dynamics
- Check if universal ratios exist without environmental parameters
- Prepare for honest acknowledgment if confirmed phenomenological

## Sprint Metrics

**Target Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Estimated Hours**: 60-80 hours (with AI assistance)
**Complexity**: High (fundamental theoretical issue)
**Risk Level**: Critical (affects entire experimental program credibility)

**Success Metrics**:
- η derived from first principles: YES/NO
- Derivation path documented: YES/NO
- T2/T1 calculated from derived η: YES/NO
- Scientific integrity restored: YES/NO (MUST BE YES)

**Two Acceptable Outcomes**:
1. ✅ Derive η → Legitimate prediction confirmed
2. ✅ Cannot derive η → Acknowledge limitation honestly

**Unacceptable Outcome**:
- ❌ Continue claiming prediction without derivation

---

## Issues and Blockers

**Current Issues**:
- Critical scientific integrity issue: Circular reasoning in T2/T1 prediction
- Previous Fisher information attempt failed (η ≈ 0.01 vs needed 0.11-0.43)

**Potential Blockers**:
- η may not be derivable from first principles (accept if true)
- Derived η may not match fitted value (determine which is wrong)
- Fisher information discrepancy may persist (investigate missing terms)
- Constraint violation may not yield quantitative η (try multiple approaches)

**Mitigation**:
- Honest assessment: If derivation fails, revise all claims
- Multiple approaches: Four independent derivation paths
- Team validation: Multi-LLM review at each phase
- Transparency: Document all attempts, successful or not

## Team Consultation History

**No consultations yet** (sprint not started)

**Planned consultations**:
1. Pre-sprint: Review all four derivation approaches, identify most promising
2. Mid-sprint: Review preliminary derivation results (Week 2)
3. Post-sprint: Final verification OR honest failure assessment

**Critical question**: "Does this derivation constitute a legitimate first-principles prediction, or is there hidden circular reasoning?"

---

## Notes

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL/URGENT** (highest priority in entire project)

**Motivation**: Scientific integrity > optimistic claims. Reddit commenter exposed a serious issue that must be resolved.

**User Directives**:
- "well. sounds like that is a more urgent priority for a sprint"
- "hang on a second - make sure and check the lean proofs and notebooks to verify - then if that is the case, do a sprint"
- "yes" (confirmed after verification)

**Impact on Other Sprints**:
- Sprint 4 (Peer Review): ON HOLD (Track 1 blocked by η derivation issue)
- Sprint 6 (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian): DEFERRED (lower priority)

**Philosophical Note**: Both success and failure are acceptable outcomes as long as we're honest. The unacceptable outcome is continuing to claim a prediction when it's actually circular reasoning.

**Status**: Sprint plan complete, ready to begin execution immediately
