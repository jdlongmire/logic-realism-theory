# Sprint 7: Derive η from First Principles (CRITICAL)

**Sprint Number**: 7
**Start Date**: 2025-10-30
**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL/URGENT** (supersedes all other sprints)
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks (estimated)
**GitHub Issue**: TBD (create new issue for η derivation)

---

## Sprint Goal

**Derive the Excluded Middle coupling parameter η from LRT first principles** without fitting to observational data, resolving the circular reasoning issue in the T2/T1 prediction.

---

## Background: Critical Scientific Integrity Issue

### The Problem (Identified via Reddit Critique)

**Current claim in paper** (Section 1.3):
> "LRT predicts T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9"

**Reality** (Section 6.3.5):
> "The coupling parameter η is currently treated as **phenomenological** (constrained by observational data) rather than derived from first principles."

**Circular reasoning**:
1. Define: T2/T1 = 1/(1+η)
2. Desire: T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9
3. Fit: η ∈ [0.11, 0.43] to achieve desired ratio
4. Claim: "LRT predicts T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9" ❌ **THIS IS NOT A PREDICTION**

**Reddit commenter's critique**:
> "The 'model' claims η exists and T2/T1 = 1/(1+η), then finds η via model fitting such that T2/T1 = 0.7-0.9. The 'model' does not derive η from first principles (6.3.5, Ongoing Work) and thus does not predict T2/T1. Why are you lying with the claim that LRT predicts these range of values?"

**Verification completed** (2025-10-30):
- ✅ Lean code: No η derivation found
- ✅ Paper Section 6.3.5: Explicitly admits η is phenomenological
- ✅ Notebook 05: Claims "from first principles" but uses fitted η
- ✅ Fisher information attempt: Yielded η ≈ 0.01 (wrong by factor ~20)

**Conclusion**: The commenter is correct. This is a critical scientific integrity issue.

## Sprint Objectives

### Primary Deliverable: Derive η from First Principles

**Success criterion**: Calculate η using ONLY LRT axioms (A = L(I), 3FLL, constraint dynamics) without reference to observed T2/T1 ratios.

**Required steps**:
1. Start from LRT axioms
2. Calculate constraint violation rates (superposition vs eigenstate)
3. Apply thermodynamic cost framework (Landauer's principle)
4. Derive decoherence rate scaling
5. Extract η from constraint dynamics
6. Calculate T2/T1 = 1/(1+η) from derived η
7. Compare to observable range

**Two possible outcomes**:

**Outcome A (Success)**: η derivation yields value consistent with T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9
- ✅ Update paper with legitimate first-principles prediction
- ✅ Update notebook 05 with proper derivation
- ✅ Respond to Reddit critique with derivation
- ✅ Proceed with experimental program confidently

**Outcome B (Failure)**: η derivation yields inconsistent value OR cannot be derived
- ✅ Revise ALL claims to acknowledge phenomenological parameter
- ✅ Update paper: "η is phenomenological, constrained by observations"
- ✅ Update README: Remove "prediction" language
- ✅ Update notebook 05: Acknowledge fitted parameter
- ✅ Respond to Reddit critique: Acknowledge limitation honestly

**Either outcome restores scientific integrity.**

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Constraint Violation Rate Analysis

**Hypothesis**: η quantifies the rate at which Excluded Middle violations occur in superposition states.

**Derivation path**:
1. Define superposition state: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
2. Calculate constraint violation: K_EM(|ψ⟩) = ?
3. Compare to eigenstate: K_EM(|0⟩) = 0 (no violation)
4. Extract violation rate: dK_EM/dt ∝ η

**Lean formalization**: `Derivations/ExcludedMiddleCoupling.lean`

**Key challenge**: Quantitatively connect EM constraint to decoherence rate

### Phase 2: Thermodynamic Cost (Landauer's Principle)

**Hypothesis**: η represents thermodynamic cost of maintaining superposition.

**Derivation path**:
1. Superposition violates EM constraint (information not fully actualized)
2. Maintaining violation requires energy: ΔE ∝ kT ln 2 (Landauer)
3. Decoherence rate: Γ_φ ∝ ΔE / ℏ
4. Extract η from Γ_φ / Γ_1 ratio

**Connection to Energy.lean**: Use Spohn's inequality (E ∝ ΔS)

**Key challenge**: Relate constraint violation to entropy change quantitatively

### Phase 3: Fisher Information Geometry (Resolution)

**Previous attempt**: Fisher information approach yielded η ≈ 0.01 (wrong)

**Discrepancy analysis**:
- Expected: η ∈ [0.11, 0.43]
- Obtained: η ≈ 0.01
- Factor: ~20x difference

**Possible issues** (from Section 6.3.5):
1. Non-perturbative corrections to Fisher metric not included
2. Additional constraint terms beyond simple K-threshold
3. Coupling to environmental degrees of freedom not captured

**Resolution strategy**:
1. Re-examine Fisher geometry calculation in detail
2. Identify missing terms or incorrect approximations
3. Include non-perturbative corrections
4. Verify against constraint violation rate from Phase 1

**Lean verification**: Update `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean` if needed

### Phase 4: Decoherence Rate Scaling

**Hypothesis**: η emerges from ratio of constraint violation timescales.

**Derivation path**:
1. Define τ_EM: timescale for EM constraint violation in superposition
2. Define τ_ID: timescale for Identity constraint violation (energy relaxation)
3. Ratio: η = τ_ID / τ_EM - 1
4. Calculate τ_EM, τ_ID from constraint dynamics

**Connection to MeasurementGeometry.lean**: Use decoherence timescale framework

**Key challenge**: Extract timescales from constraint threshold K dynamics

### Phase 5: Integration and Validation

**Cross-checks**:
1. Verify η derivation is consistent across all four approaches
2. Ensure no circular dependencies on T2/T1 observations
3. Calculate T2/T1 = 1/(1+η) from derived η
4. Compare to observable range (T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9)
5. If inconsistent: Determine which is wrong (theory or observation claim)

**Documentation**:
- Update Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md Section 6.3.5
- Remove "phenomenological" language if derivation succeeds
- Update notebook 05_T2_T1_Derivation.ipynb with proper derivation
- Create new section "First-Principles Derivation of η"

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Derivation May Fail (Cannot Derive η from First Principles)
**Impact**: Would undermine experimental program's claim to predictive power

**Mitigation**:
- Accept this outcome honestly if it occurs
- Revise all claims to acknowledge limitation
- Reframe experimental work as "consistency validation" not "prediction testing"
- Scientific integrity > optimistic claims

### Risk 2: Derived η May Not Match Fitted Value
**Impact**: Either derivation is wrong OR fitted range is wrong

**Mitigation**:
- If derived η differs by factor <2: Investigate approximations, corrections
- If derived η differs by factor >2: Accept that one is wrong, determine which
- Possibility: LRT framework needs revision OR T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 is not correct prediction

### Risk 3: Fisher Information Discrepancy May Persist
**Impact**: One of the primary quantitative frameworks (Fisher geometry) fails

**Mitigation**:
- Systematically identify missing terms in Fisher metric calculation
- Include non-perturbative corrections
- If still fails: Document failure mode and use alternative approach
- Consider that Fisher geometry may not be the right tool for this derivation

### Risk 4: Constraint Violation May Not Yield Quantitative η
**Impact**: Qualitative framework exists but quantitative derivation remains elusive

**Mitigation**:
- Attempt multiple approaches (thermodynamic, geometric, dynamical)
- If all fail: Acknowledge η must remain phenomenological
- Document what was attempted and why it failed
- Transparency about limitations

## Multi-LLM Consultation Plan

**Consultation Points**:
1. **Pre-sprint**: Review all four derivation approaches, identify most promising
2. **Mid-sprint (Week 2)**: Review preliminary derivation results
3. **Post-sprint**: Final verification of derivation OR honest assessment of failure

**Quality Threshold**: ≥0.70 average score for GO

**Critical question for team**: "Does this derivation constitute a legitimate first-principles prediction, or is there hidden circular reasoning?"

**Budget**: 3 consultations × 3 models = 9 API calls

---

## Notes

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** (highest priority, supersedes Sprint 6 and all other work)

**Motivation**: Scientific integrity demands honesty about what is derived vs what is fitted. The Reddit critique exposed a serious issue that must be resolved before making any further claims.

**User directive**: "well. sounds like that is a more urgent priority for a sprint" → "yes" (confirmed after verification)

**Impact**:
- **High**: Restores credibility to experimental program
- **High**: Demonstrates commitment to scientific integrity over hype
- **High**: Either validates prediction OR forces honest reassessment of claims

**Two possible outcomes, both acceptable**:
1. ✅ Successfully derive η → Legitimate prediction, proceed confidently
2. ✅ Cannot derive η → Acknowledge limitation, revise claims honestly

**Both outcomes are scientifically valid. Only unacceptable outcome is continuing to claim prediction without derivation.**
