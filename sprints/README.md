# Sprint Overview - ACTIVE

**Sprint System**: Used for **multi-week, multi-track substantive work** (theoretical derivations, major revisions)

**Session System**: [`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/) tracks **individual work sessions** within and across sprints

**Latest Session**: [Session 5.3](../Session_Log/Session_5.3.md) - Measurement Module Refactoring Complete

## Sprint vs Session Tracking

**Sprints** (this folder):
- ‚úÖ Multi-week scope (2-8 weeks typically)
- ‚úÖ Multiple parallel tracks (theoretical, implementation, validation)
- ‚úÖ Strategic planning with deliverables
- ‚úÖ Multi-LLM team consultations
- ‚úÖ Used for substantive theoretical work

**Sessions** ([`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/)):
- ‚úÖ Individual work sessions (hours to days)
- ‚úÖ Progressive updates (Session_X.Y format)
- ‚úÖ Detailed git commit history
- ‚úÖ Cross-references sprint work
- ‚úÖ Day-to-day development tracking

**Complementary**: Sessions document work within sprints. Sprints provide strategic structure for complex projects.

## Active Sprints

### Sprint 7: Derive Œ∑ from First Principles üî¥ **CRITICAL/URGENT**

**Status**: Planning ‚Üí Ready to Start
**Created**: October 30, 2025 (Session 5.3)
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL (supersedes all other sprints)
**Target Completion**: November 27, 2025
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**GitHub Issue**: TBD

**Objective**: Derive the Excluded Middle coupling parameter Œ∑ from LRT first principles without fitting to observational data, resolving circular reasoning issue in T2/T1 prediction

**Critical Issue**: Reddit commenter correctly identified that current T2/T1 ‚âà 0.7-0.9 "prediction" is circular reasoning (Œ∑ is fitted to achieve desired ratio, not derived from first principles per Section 6.3.5)

**Major Deliverables**:
- [ ] Œ∑ derivation from LRT axioms (NO data fitting)
- [ ] T2/T1 = 1/(1+Œ∑) calculated from derived Œ∑
- [ ] Fisher information discrepancy resolved (why Œ∑ ‚âà 0.01 vs needed 0.11-0.43)
- [ ] Lean formalization: ExcludedMiddleCoupling.lean (0 sorry)
- [ ] Update paper Section 6.3.5 with derivation OR honest acknowledgment of limitation
- [ ] Scientific integrity restored (either outcome acceptable)

**Phases**:
- Phase 1: Constraint violation rate analysis
- Phase 2: Thermodynamic cost (Landauer's principle)
- Phase 3: Fisher information geometry resolution
- Phase 4: Decoherence rate scaling
- Phase 5: Integration & validation

**Two Acceptable Outcomes**:
1. ‚úÖ Successfully derive Œ∑ ‚Üí Legitimate prediction confirmed
2. ‚úÖ Cannot derive Œ∑ ‚Üí Revise all claims honestly to acknowledge phenomenological parameter

### Sprint 6: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulation üü° **DEFERRED**

**Status**: Planning (Deferred pending Sprint 7)
**Created**: October 30, 2025 (Session 5.3)
**Priority**: Medium (lower than Sprint 7)
**Target Completion**: TBD (after Sprint 7 complete)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**GitHub Issue**: [#2 - don't forget Lagrangian and Hamiltonian](https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory/issues/2)

**Objective**: Derive Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms from LRT first principles

**Status Note**: Sprint 6 planning complete, but deferred to allow Sprint 7 (critical scientific integrity issue) to take priority.

See: [`sprint_6/SPRINT_6_PLAN.md`](sprint_6/SPRINT_6_PLAN.md) for full details

### Sprint 4: Peer Review Response - Major Revisions ‚è∏Ô∏è **ON HOLD**

**Status**: ON HOLD (blocked by Sprint 7)
**Started**: October 27, 2025 (Session 3.8)
**Target Completion**: TBD (resume after Sprint 7)
**Duration**: 4 weeks

**Objective**: Address critical peer review feedback for foundational paper

**Major Deliverables**:
- [ ] T2/T1 quantitative derivation (BLOCKED - requires Œ∑ derivation from Sprint 7)
- [ ] Non-unitary evolution resolution (theoretical framework)
- [ ] Confound isolation strategies (experimental design)
- [ ] Paper revisions (5 new/updated sections)
- [ ] Multi-LLM validation (quality ‚â• 0.80)

**Status Note**: Sprint 4 Track 1 (T2/T1 quantitative derivation) is blocked by the Œ∑ derivation issue addressed in Sprint 7. Sprint 4 will resume after Sprint 7 resolves the circular reasoning problem.
