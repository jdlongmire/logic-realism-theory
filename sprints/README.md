# Sprint Overview - DEPRECATED

**⚠️ Note**: The sprint system was used for Sessions 1.x but has been **superseded by the Session_Log/ tracking system** as of Session 2.0.

**For current development tracking**, see [`../Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/).

**Latest Session**: [Session 3.6](../Session_Log/Session_3.6.md) - Multi-LLM Team Review + Gap Remediation

---

## Why Deprecated?

The Session_Log/ system provides more comprehensive tracking:
- ✅ Complete session history with git commits
- ✅ Cross-references to all files modified
- ✅ Multi-LLM consultations documented
- ✅ Progressive updates throughout each session
- ✅ Better suited for research workflow (vs software sprints)
