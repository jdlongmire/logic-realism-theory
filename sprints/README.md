## Sprint Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

### Critical Rules

1. **Sprint folders contain ONLY tracking documents**
   - ❌ NO subfolders: team_consultations/, notebooks/, lean/
   - ✅ ONLY markdown tracking files

2. **Deliverables go to canonical locations**:
   - Notebooks → `notebooks/`
   - Lean files → `lean/LogicRealismTheory/`
   - Consultations → `multi_LLM/consultation/`
   - Sprint docs → `sprints/sprint_X/` (tracking only)

3. **Progressive updates**:
   - Update tracking document daily
   - Commit after each major milestone
   - Cross-reference with session logs

### Sprint Structure

Each sprint folder contains:
- `SPRINT_X_PLAN.md` - Sprint-specific plan and goals
- `SPRINT_X_TRACKING.md` - Daily progress tracking (updated continuously)
- `SPRINT_X_COMPLETE.md` - Completion summary (created at end)

## Active Sprint: Sprint 2

**Focus**: Derive fundamental physics from logical constraints

**Key Goals**:
1. Time Emergence - Stone's theorem → U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ) (Lean + Notebook)
2. Energy Derivation - Spohn's inequality → E ∝ ΔS (Lean + Notebook)
3. Russell Paradox Filtering - NC filters contradictions (Lean + Notebook)
4. (Optional) Quantum Superposition and Measurement Collapse (Notebooks)

**Success Criteria**:
- All Lean proofs: 0 sorry, builds successfully
- All notebooks: Execute successfully, professional format
- 2 axioms maintained (no new axioms)
- Cross-references between Lean and notebooks

See: `sprint_2/SPRINT_2_PLAN.md` for details

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 1: Lean Operators & First Notebook ✅

**Duration**: Sessions 1.2-1.6 (October 25, 2025)

**Deliverables Completed**:
- ✅ Track 0: CI/CD Infrastructure (3 GitHub Actions workflows)
- ✅ Track 1: Lean Operators (`Operators/Projectors.lean`, 0 sorry)
- ✅ Track 2: Notebook 01 (`notebooks/01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb`, executes successfully)
- ✅ Track 3: Actualization (`Foundation/Actualization.lean`, 0 sorry)

**Quality Metrics** (All Exceeded):
- Axioms: **2** ✅ (target: ≤ 5)
- Sorry: **0** ✅ (target: ≤ 1 acceptable)
- Build: Success ✅
- Notebook execution: Success ✅
- CI/CD: Active ✅

**Status**: 100% complete, ready for Sprint 2
