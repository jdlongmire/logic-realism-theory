# Sprint Overview - ACTIVE

**Sprint System**: Used for **multi-week, multi-track substantive work** (theoretical derivations, major revisions)

**Session System**: [`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/) tracks **individual work sessions** within and across sprints

**Latest Session**: [Session 5.3](../Session_Log/Session_5.3.md) - Measurement Module Refactoring Complete

## Sprint vs Session Tracking

**Sprints** (this folder):
- ‚úÖ Multi-week scope (2-8 weeks typically)
- ‚úÖ Multiple parallel tracks (theoretical, implementation, validation)
- ‚úÖ Strategic planning with deliverables
- ‚úÖ Multi-LLM team consultations
- ‚úÖ Used for substantive theoretical work

**Sessions** ([`Session_Log/`](../Session_Log/)):
- ‚úÖ Individual work sessions (hours to days)
- ‚úÖ Progressive updates (Session_X.Y format)
- ‚úÖ Detailed git commit history
- ‚úÖ Cross-references sprint work
- ‚úÖ Day-to-day development tracking

**Complementary**: Sessions document work within sprints. Sprints provide strategic structure for complex projects.

## Active Sprints

### Sprint 8: Honest Framing of Œ∑ Derivation üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Status**: üü° Ready to Start (Planning Complete)
**Created**: October 30, 2025 (post-Sprint 7)
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL (integrates Sprint 7 findings)
**Target Completion**: November 13, 2025
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**GitHub Issue**: TBD

**Objective**: Integrate Sprint 7 findings (Œ≤ = 3/4 variational derivation) into all project materials with scientifically honest framing that will pass peer review

**Context**: Sprint 7 achieved partial derivation via variational optimization. Sprint 8 updates paper, notebooks, and documentation to reflect this honestly.

**Three Tracks**:
1. **Track 1**: Core paper sections (Abstract, Section 1, Section 6)
2. **Track 2**: Notebooks (create Notebook 07, update Notebook 05)
3. **Track 3**: Supporting docs (README, cross-references, consistency)

**Major Deliverables**:
- [ ] Paper Abstract updated (remove "first-principles", add "variational optimization")
- [ ] Section 6.3 rewritten with variational derivation
- [ ] Notebook 07 created: Variational Beta Derivation
- [ ] Notebook 05 updated with references to Sprint 7
- [ ] All Œ∑ ‚àà [0.11, 0.43] ‚Üí Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23
- [ ] All T2/T1 ‚âà 0.7-0.9 ‚Üí T2/T1 ‚âà 0.81
- [ ] Assumptions explicitly listed
- [ ] Multi-LLM review ‚â• 0.70

**Framing**: "Theoretically motivated hypothesis from variational optimization" (NOT "first-principles derivation")

See: [`sprint_8/SPRINT_8_PLAN.md`](sprint_8/SPRINT_8_PLAN.md) for full details

### Sprint 6: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulation üü° **DEFERRED**

**Status**: Planning (Deferred pending Sprint 7)
**Created**: October 30, 2025 (Session 5.3)
**Priority**: Medium (lower than Sprint 7)
**Target Completion**: TBD (after Sprint 7 complete)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**GitHub Issue**: [#2 - don't forget Lagrangian and Hamiltonian](https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory/issues/2)

**Objective**: Derive Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms from LRT first principles

**Status Note**: Sprint 6 planning complete, but deferred to allow Sprint 7 (critical scientific integrity issue) to take priority.

See: [`sprint_6/SPRINT_6_PLAN.md`](sprint_6/SPRINT_6_PLAN.md) for full details

### Sprint 4: Peer Review Response - Major Revisions ‚è∏Ô∏è **ON HOLD**

**Status**: ON HOLD (blocked by Sprint 7)
**Started**: October 27, 2025 (Session 3.8)
**Target Completion**: TBD (resume after Sprint 7)
**Duration**: 4 weeks

**Objective**: Address critical peer review feedback for foundational paper

**Major Deliverables**:
- [ ] T2/T1 quantitative derivation (BLOCKED - requires Œ∑ derivation from Sprint 7)
- [ ] Non-unitary evolution resolution (theoretical framework)
- [ ] Confound isolation strategies (experimental design)
- [ ] Paper revisions (5 new/updated sections)
- [ ] Multi-LLM validation (quality ‚â• 0.80)

**Status Note**: Sprint 4 Track 1 (T2/T1 quantitative derivation) is blocked by the Œ∑ derivation issue addressed in Sprint 7. Sprint 4 will resume after Sprint 7 resolves the circular reasoning problem.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 7: Derive Œ∑ from First Principles ‚úÖ PHASES 1-2 COMPLETE

**Duration**: October 30, 2025 (same day!)
**Status**: Phases 1-2 Complete (Phases 3-5 deemed unnecessary)
**Achievement**: **DERIVATION ACHIEVED** - Œ≤ = 3/4 from variational principle

**Deliverables Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Constraint violation rate (Œì_œÜ = kT ln 2 / ‚Ñè)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Universal ratio analysis (30 approaches, g ‚àà [0.70, 0.79])
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 Continued: **Variational derivation Œ≤ = 3/4** ‚Üí Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23
- ‚úÖ Computational validation: g = 0.749110 (0.12% from 3/4)
- ‚úÖ Scientific integrity restored (honest framing, testable hypothesis)

**Key Outcome**: Derived Œ≤ = 3/4 from variational optimization (minimize K_total[g] = violations + enforcement). Predicts Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23, T2/T1 ‚âà 0.81. Status: Theoretically motivated hypothesis (not pure first-principles, requires 4-step measurement + temperature T).

**35 approaches documented**, ~6,500 lines of rigorous analysis

See: [`sprint_7/Sprint7_Phases1-2_Summary.md`](sprint_7/Sprint7_Phases1-2_Summary.md) for complete assessment
