## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Track 0: CI/CD Infrastructure (Standard Software Practices)

**Files**: `.github/workflows/*.yml`

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow for Lean builds
   - Automated `lake build` on every push
   - Cache Mathlib for faster builds
   - Report build status
2. ✅ Create workflow for sorry statement checking
   - Automated grep for sorry
   - Fail CI if sorry count > 0
   - Maintain 0 sorry guarantee
3. ✅ Create workflow for axiom counting
   - Count axioms in Lean code
   - Fail/warn if axiom count > 2
   - Maintain ultra-minimalism
4. ✅ Create workflow for notebook testing
   - Execute all notebooks
   - Validate code cells work
   - Check copyright headers
5. ✅ Create workflow for documentation checks
   - Verify required files exist
   - Check for broken internal links
   - Validate Session Log sequence

**Estimated Effort**: ✅ Complete (Session 1.2)

**Reference**: Standard CI/CD practices for Lean + Jupyter projects

### Track 1: Lean Operators (Foundational Paper Section 3.3)

**File**: `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Operators/Projectors.lean`

**Tasks**:
1. Create Operators folder and file structure
2. Import necessary Mathlib components (Hilbert space, projectors)
3. Define Π_id (persistence projector):
   - Acts on paths γ: [0,t] → ℋ
   - Projects onto identity-preserving subspace
   - Ensures causal continuity
4. Define {Π_i} (incompatibility family):
   - Orthogonality condition: Π_i Π_j = 0 for incompatible i ≠ j
   - Enforces mutual exclusion
5. Define R (resolution map):
   - R: {Π_i} → {0,1} subject to Σ_i R(Π_i) = 1
   - Forces binary resolution (measurement)
   - Category-theoretic: Bool → Heyt right adjoint
6. Implement composition:
   - L_composed = EM ∘ NC ∘ Id
   - Show sequential constraint application
7. Verify builds, 0 sorry

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 development sessions

**Reference**: Foundational paper Section 3.3 (lines 122-166)

### Track 2: First Notebook (Foundational Paper Section 2)

**File**: `notebooks/01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb`

**Tasks**:
1. Set up notebook structure:
   - Title: "Infinite Information Space and the Three Fundamental Laws"
   - 3-line copyright format (JD Longmire, Apache 2.0)
   - Purpose statement
2. Section 1: The 2-Axiom Foundation
   - Explain I exists, I infinite
   - Show ultra-minimalism (98.6% reduction)
3. Section 2: 3FLL as Necessity
   - Implement necessity arguments from foundational paper Section 2.4:
     - Identity necessary for being (persistence)
     - Non-Contradiction necessary for information (distinction)
     - Excluded Middle necessary for determinacy (actualization)
   - Computational demonstrations
4. Section 3: 3FLL as Theorems
   - Show they're proven in Lean (not axiomatized)
   - Code examples demonstrating each law
5. Section 4: L as Unified Constraint
   - Demonstrate L bundling the 3FLL
   - Visualizations of constraint application
6. Professional tone:
   - No thinking commentary
   - No self-corrections
   - Direct, scholarly presentation
7. Test all code cells, ensure reproducibility

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 development sessions

**Reference**: Foundational paper Section 2 (lines 24-80)

### Track 3: Actualization (Optional, Foundational Paper Section 3.2)

**File**: `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Foundation/Actualization.lean`

**Tasks** (if time permits):
1. Define A as filtered subspace
2. Formalize A = L(I) relationship
3. Prove A ⊂ I (actualization is subset of information space)
4. Connect to operator definitions

**Estimated Effort**: 1 development session

**Reference**: Foundational paper Section 3.2, Axiom 3 (line 120)

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Sprint 1 Complete)
- ✅ CI/CD infrastructure in place (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Operators defined in Lean (Π_id, {Π_i}, R)
- ✅ Lean builds successfully, 0 sorry maintained
- ✅ CI passes (automated sorry/axiom checking)
- ✅ Notebook 01 created and complete
- ✅ Notebook follows professional standards
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ All deliverables in canonical locations (not in sprint folder)

### Should Have
- ✅ Actualization defined (A as filtered subspace)
- ✅ Cross-references complete (Lean ↔ paper sections)
- ✅ Session logs updated (progressive tracking)

### Nice to Have
- Team consultation on operator definitions (quality score >0.70)
- Visualization of constraint hierarchy in notebook
- Example applications of operators

---

## Team Consultation Budget

**Available for Sprint 1**: Allocate 3-5 consultations (from total budget)

**Potential Topics**:
1. Operator definitions review (Π_id, {Π_i}, R correctness)
2. Notebook 01 technical review (accuracy, clarity)
3. Actualization formalization review (if completed)

**Quality Requirement**: Average score >0.70

**Location**: All results saved to `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_1_*.txt|.json`

---

## Timeline (Estimated)

**Week 1** (Sessions 1.2-1.4):
- Create operator definitions (Π_id, {Π_i}, R)
- Begin Notebook 01 (structure and Section 1-2)

**Week 2** (Sessions 1.5-1.7):
- Complete Notebook 01 (Sections 3-4)
- Optional: Actualization definition
- Team consultations (if needed)

**Week 3** (Sessions 1.8-1.9):
- Final review and testing
- Documentation updates
- Sprint completion summary

**Total Duration**: 2-3 weeks (flexible based on complexity)

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Operator Definition Complexity
**Risk**: Hilbert space formalism in Lean may be complex
**Mitigation**: Start with abstract definitions, defer full proofs to later sprints if needed
**Fallback**: Define operators abstractly, mark full proofs as "to be completed"

### Risk 2: Notebook Scope Creep
**Risk**: Notebook 01 tries to cover too much
**Mitigation**: Focus strictly on IIS + 3FLL necessity (foundational paper Section 2)
**Fallback**: Split into two notebooks if scope exceeds ~5,000 words

### Risk 3: Time Constraints
**Risk**: Sprint takes longer than estimated
**Mitigation**: Prioritize must-haves; defer nice-to-haves
**Fallback**: Mark Sprint 1 complete with operators + notebook; defer actualization to Sprint 2

---

## Integration Points

### With Foundational Paper
- Operators → Section 3.3 (direct implementation)
- Notebook 01 → Section 2 (necessity arguments)
- Actualization → Section 3.2, Axiom 3

### With Future Sprints
- **Sprint 2**: Use operators to prove derivations (time, energy)
- **Sprint 3**: Notebook 02 (operator formalism demonstrations)
- **Sprint 4**: Beta prediction notebook (QEC entropy correlation)

### With Session Logs
- Update session logs progressively
- Cross-reference sprint tracking ↔ session logs
- Both should reflect same progress
