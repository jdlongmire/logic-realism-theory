# Sprint 4 Tracking: Peer Review Response

**Sprint**: 4
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: October 27, 2025
**Target Completion**: November 24, 2025

## Daily Log

### October 27, 2025 - Sprint Initialization

**Session**: 3.8

**Activities**:
- ✅ Sprint plan created (`SPRINT_4_PLAN.md`)
- ✅ Sprint tracking initialized
- ✅ Analyzed peer review feedback in detail
- ✅ Identified 5 critical issues requiring resolution

**Peer Review Analysis**:
- Recommendation: Major Revisions Required
- Reviewer Quality: Excellent (high expertise, constructive feedback)
- Critical Gaps: T2/T1 derivation, non-unitary evolution, signal isolation
- Timeline: 4 weeks estimated for substantive theoretical work

**Sprint Structure**:
- Track 1: Theoretical Derivations (Weeks 1-3)
- Track 2: Paper Revisions (Weeks 2-4)
- Track 3: Team Validation (Week 4)

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Task 1.1 (T2/T1 derivation) - CRITICAL PATH
- Quick win: Task 2.1 (Lean language fix)

## Track Status

### Track 1: Theoretical Derivations

| Task | Priority | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1.1 T2/T1 Derivation | HIGHEST | Not Started | 0% | Blocks resubmission |
| 1.2 Non-Unitary Resolution | HIGH | Not Started | 0% | Choose Option A/B/C |
| 1.3 Thermodynamics Framework | MEDIUM | Not Started | 0% | Strengthens foundation |

### Track 2: Paper Revisions

| Task | Priority | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 2.1 Lean Language Fix | HIGH | Not Started | 0% | Easy win (~1 hour) |
| 2.2 Ontological/Epistemic | HIGH | Not Started | 0% | Section 2.3.1 |
| 2.3 Confound Isolation | HIGH | Not Started | 0% | Section 5.1 expansion |
| 2.4 Integrate T2/T1 | HIGH | Blocked | 0% | Depends on 1.1 |
| 2.5 Integrate Non-Unitary | HIGH | Blocked | 0% | Depends on 1.2 |

### Track 3: Team Validation

| Task | Priority | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 3.1 Multi-LLM Review | HIGH | Not Started | 0% | Week 4 |
| 3.2 Response Letter | MEDIUM | Not Started | 0% | After all revisions |

## Team Consultations (Budget: 3-5 for Sprint)

| Date | Topic | Models | Quality | Outcome |
|------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| - | - | - | - | - |

**Remaining Budget**: 3-5 consultations

## Integration Notes

**Session Log**: Session_3.8.md
**Related Sprints**: None (first response to peer review)
**Dependencies**: Foundational paper Rev 2.9

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Sprint Scope
**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Decision**: Full major revision (4 weeks) rather than partial response
**Rationale**: Reviewer feedback is valid, gaps are real, worth doing right
**Impact**: Delays potential submission but ensures quality

---

## Notes

**Sprint Philosophy**:
- Rigor over speed
- Honest engagement with critiques
- Substantive theoretical work required

**Critical Path**: Task 1.1 (T2/T1 derivation)
- Must start immediately
- If intractable, reassess scope by Week 2
