  <h1>Wheeler's "It from Bit"</h1>
  <p>Grounding Information in Logical Admissibility</p>
</div>

John Archibald Wheeler proposed that physical reality ("it") emerges from informational yes/no questions ("bit"). This was visionary but programmatic. Logic Realism Theory provides the **grounding** Wheeler never fully articulated.

## Wheeler's Vision

Wheeler (1990) proposed:

> "Every it—every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely—even if in some contexts indirectly—from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits."

This reverses the usual picture:
- **Standard view:** Physics first, information emerges from physical processes
- **Wheeler:** Information first, physics emerges from informational structure

But Wheeler left key questions unanswered:
- What *is* a bit, fundamentally?
- How do bits become "its"?
- Why does this produce quantum structure specifically?

## LRT's Grounding

Logic Realism Theory answers each question:

### What is a bit?

A **bit** is the minimal unit of distinguishability—one binary distinction—constituted by Determinate Identity (Id).

For a bit to be meaningful:
- Each alternative must be determinately itself (Id)
- The alternatives must be determinately different ($A \neq B$ from Id)
- Selection of one excludes the other (NC + EM from Id)

Without Id, "0 or 1" is not a genuine distinction. The bit is not a primitive posit—it is **what Id looks like** when applied to a minimal binary domain.

### How do bits become "its"?

Through the **interface** between $I_\infty$ and $A_\Omega$.

Possibilities in $I_\infty$ (the space of all representable configurations) become actual when $L_3$ are enforced. Measurement is this interface: quantum states encode possibilities; outcomes are $L_3$-admissible records.

Physical reality emerges because:
1. $I_\infty$ is structured by distinguishability (bits)
2. $A_\Omega$ requires Boolean outcomes (bit-definite)
3. The interface between them produces physics

### Why quantum structure?

Because quantum mechanics is the **unique stable interface**—the only structure that:
- Satisfies the $I_\infty$/$A_\Omega$ interface constraints
- Produces stable physics (atoms, chemistry, observers)

Classical structure satisfies interface constraints but does not produce stability. Other structures fail the constraints entirely.

## The Extended Slogan: Bit from Fit

LRT extends Wheeler's slogan:

**It from bit:** Physical reality emerges from information

**Bit from fit:** The bit (fundamental distinction) emerges from the *fit* between $I_\infty$ and $A_\Omega$

The "fit" is the fine-tuning. Quantum structure fits—it interfaces correctly while producing stable physics. The bit exists because $L_3$ permits distinction; quantum mechanics is what bit-structure looks like when actualized.

## The Bit Scale

If the bit is fundamental and physics emerges from it, there should be a conversion between informational and physical quantities.

**$\hbar$ (Planck's constant)** is the natural candidate:

$$\text{Action} = \hbar \times \text{Complexity}$$

$\hbar$ is the quantum of action—the minimal amount of physical change. If it is also the bit-action conversion factor:

- The **Planck scale** is where bit-structure becomes directly relevant
- The **classical world** emerges from coarse-graining over many bits
- Quantum "weirdness" is the friction between bit-structure and continuous appearance

## Supporting Evidence

Several independent results support the bit-reality connection:

**Bekenstein bound:** Maximum entropy of a region is proportional to surface area in Planck units—roughly one bit per Planck area. If $\hbar$ is the bit-action conversion, this bound follows from finite action capacity.

**Black hole entropy:** The Bekenstein-Hawking formula gives entropy proportional to horizon area in Planck units. In LRT terms: the horizon bounds the distinguishability capacity of the interior.

**Landauer's principle:** Erasing one bit costs at least $kT \ln 2$ of energy. Destroying a distinction has thermodynamic cost because distinctions are ontologically real.

**Holographic principle:** Information content is bounded by surface area, not volume. Distinguishability has a spatial density limit.

## Completing Wheeler's Program

Wheeler's program lacked:

1. **Grounding for the bit:** LRT provides it—$L_3$ constitute distinguishability
2. **Mechanism for emergence:** LRT provides it—the $I_\infty$/$A_\Omega$ interface
3. **Explanation of quantum structure:** LRT provides it—unique stable interface

Wheeler intuited that information is fundamental. LRT shows **why**—because logic is fundamental, and the bit is what logic looks like at minimal scale.
