  <h1>One-World Realism</h1>
  <p>Everettian Mathematics Without Many-Worlds Ontology</p>
</div>

**One-world realism** is LRT's position on quantum ontology: preserving the mathematical insights of Many-Worlds while restoring a single actuality.

---

## The Many-Worlds Picture

Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) makes three key claims:

1. **Wave function realism:** The quantum state is ontologically real
2. **No collapse mechanism:** Schrödinger evolution is universal
3. **All branches actual:** Every measurement outcome occurs in some branch; the universe constantly splits

MWI elegantly avoids collapse but at a cost: infinite parallel worlds, with all outcomes equally real.

---

## What MWI Gets Right

LRT agrees with MWI on:

**Wave function is ontologically real.** The quantum state is not "just math" or epistemic uncertainty. It describes genuine structure in $I_\infty$.

**Collapse is not a special mechanism.** There is no dynamical collapse process requiring new physics. "Measurement" is not a fundamental concept requiring special treatment.

**No hidden variables.** The $I_\infty$ state is genuinely indeterminate before measurement, not secretly determinate but unknown.

---

## What LRT Changes

LRT denies that all branches are equally actual. Instead:

**Possibilities are real** (they exist in $I_\infty$)

**One actuality** ($L_3$ enforce a single determinate outcome)

**Other possibilities remain in $I_\infty$**, not in parallel branches

---

## The Key Distinction

In MWI, "branching" is ontological multiplication—the universe literally splits into copies.

In LRT, "branching" is the structure of $I_\infty$—all possibilities are there, but only one actualizes.

| Feature | Many-Worlds | LRT |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Wave function real? | Yes | Yes |
| Collapse mechanism? | No | No |
| Hidden variables? | No | No |
| All outcomes actual? | Yes | **No** |
| Ontological cost | Infinite worlds | Single actuality |

## Born Rule and Branch Weights

MWI faces the **probability problem**: if all branches are equally real, why do we observe Born-rule statistics? Decision-theoretic derivations are contested.

LRT avoids this problem entirely:
- The Born rule is **derived** from vehicle-invariance (not decision theory)
- Probabilities describe objective dispositions toward one actual outcome
- No need to explain why we're "more likely" to find ourselves in high-weight branches

The Born rule weights don't describe "how much reality each branch gets." They describe the objective disposition of a single world toward its possible futures.

---

## Ontological Parsimony

MWI multiplies worlds beyond necessity. Every quantum event splits reality into as many branches as there are outcomes. This continues recursively—leading to a vast (perhaps infinite) multiverse.

LRT is ontologically parsimonious:
- One actual world
- One evolving configuration in $A_\Omega$
- Possibilities in $I_\infty$ (which exists regardless of whether possibilities are "real" in some metaphysical sense)

The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is preserved. The ontological inflation is avoided.

---

## Measurement Without Collapse

How does LRT explain definite outcomes without collapse?

**Measurement** is the interface between $I_\infty$ and $A_\Omega$. When a quantum state couples to a macroscopic record:

1. The $I_\infty$ structure encodes outcome possibilities
2. $L_3$ enforcement selects exactly one outcome for instantiation
3. The record is determinately one thing or another

This is not a dynamical process but a **category transition**—from representing possibilities to instantiating actuality.

---

## What Remains

LRT does not explain:
- **Why THIS outcome** rather than THAT outcome
- **The physical criterion** marking the $I_\infty$/$A_\Omega$ boundary

These may be irreducibly stochastic (first question) or empirically determined (second question). Neither requires Many-Worlds ontology.
