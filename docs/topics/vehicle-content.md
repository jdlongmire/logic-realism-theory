  <h1>Vehicle/Content Distinction</h1>
  <p>How Minds Represent What Reality Cannot Instantiate</p>
</div>

The **vehicle/content distinction** explains a central puzzle: how can minds coherently represent contradictions, impossibilities, and $L_3$ violations when reality cannot instantiate them?

## The Distinction

A representation has two components:

**Vehicle:** The physical structure doing the representing—a brain state, quantum state, measurement apparatus, or symbolic inscription. Vehicles must satisfy $L_3$; they are actual configurations.

**Content:** What is represented—outcome possibilities, measurement alternatives, even contradictions and impossibilities. Contents need not satisfy $L_3$.

This asymmetry is the key insight: the *representing* is always $L_3$-admissible, even when the *represented* is not.

## The Asymmetry as Evidence

If $L_3$ constrained only representation (as psychologism claims), then:
- Representing violations should be difficult or impossible (vehicles must satisfy $L_3$)
- Instantiating violations should be possible (reality would be unconstrained)

If $L_3$ constrains only instantiation (as Logic Realism claims), then:
- Representing violations should be possible (vehicles satisfy $L_3$ while contents need not)
- Instantiating violations should be impossible ($A_\Omega$ is defined by $L_3$ satisfaction)

The empirical record supports the second pattern. **Conceiving contradictions is cognitively trivial; instantiating them has never been observed.** This asymmetry is the empirical foundation of Logic Realism Theory.

## Superposition as Vehicle

The vehicle/content distinction becomes essential in quantum mechanics. A quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ is not a direct description of an instantiated configuration but a **representational vehicle** encoding outcome-possibilities.

Consider the paradigm case:

$$|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$$

This superposition:
- **As vehicle:** Is a precise, well-defined mathematical object with definite coefficients, inner products, and evolution under unitary operators
- **As content:** Describes a physical situation that is not yet determinate with respect to "has definite value 0 or 1 in this basis"

The state does not represent a configuration that both has and lacks a definite value (NC violation). It represents a physical situation such that when measurement occurs, exactly one outcome will be recorded—and that record will be $L_3$-admissible.

## Layered Representation

The LRT picture has three layers:

**Layer 1: $I_\infty$ (Representable configurations)**
All specifications, including contradictions and impossibilities. No constraint.

**Layer 2: Quantum states as representational vehicles**
Well-defined Hilbert space vectors. These are $L_3$-consistent descriptions within mathematical formalism. They encode outcome-possibilities via probability distributions.

**Layer 3: Measurement outcomes as instantiated records**
Sharp property assignments in stable, public records. Determinately 0 or 1, spin-up or spin-down. Only this layer is directly instantiated as public record.

Layer 2 is the theory's vehicle for representing how Layer 3 distributions arise from physical situations. The vehicle/content distinction operates at each level.

## Why This Matters

The vehicle/content distinction:

1. **Explains representation of impossibilities:** Minds represent round squares without instantiating them because the vehicle (brain state) is $L_3$-admissible even when the content is not

2. **Dissolves superposition paradoxes:** Superposition is not a contradiction but a determinate vehicle encoding indeterminate content

3. **Grounds probability objectively:** The measure over outcomes belongs to the vehicle, not the content—it characterizes how the physical situation is objectively poised toward outcomes

4. **Enables the Born rule derivation:** Vehicle-invariance (probability assignments independent of mathematically equivalent decompositions) forces the $\lvert\psi\rvert^2$ form via Gleason's theorem
