## The Core Thesis

**Logic Realism Theory (LRT)** treats the three classical logical laws—Determinate Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle (collectively $L_3$)—as *ontological constraints on physical instantiation*, not merely rules of inference.

The framework distinguishes:

- **$I_\infty$**: The space of all representable configurations (including contradictions and impossibilities)
- **$A_\Omega$**: The $L_3$-admissible subset that can be physically instantiated as stable records

This boundary condition generates quantum structure. Vehicle-invariance under mathematically equivalent decompositions forces the Born rule via Gleason's theorem. Local tomography requirements select complex Hilbert space over real alternatives.

> *It from Bit, Bit from Fit*: Physical structure emerges from informational structure, which emerges from logical admissibility.

## Research Programme

LRT is a **Lakatosian progressive research programme** with:

- **Hard core**: $L_3$ as constraints on physical instantiation
- **Protective belt**: Vehicle-invariance formulation, Hilbert space representation, interface criteria
- **Novel predictions**: Complex QM requirement (confirmed by Renou et al. 2021), derivable collapse parameters, Tsirelson bound

The programme derives quantum structure rather than postulating it:

| Result | Derived From |
|--------|--------------|
| Born rule ($\|\psi\|^2$) | Vehicle-invariance (Determinate Identity) |
| Complex Hilbert space | Local tomography requirement |
| Symmetrization postulate | Identity constraints on identical particles |
| Tsirelson bound | Hilbert space structure |
