# Computational Validation

**Status**: Stub (to be developed)

## Notebook Suite

The 9-notebook validation suite computationally verifies all major derivations.

See: `../notebooks/README.md` for complete notebook descriptions.

## Approach 2 Reference

For comprehensive computational exploration, see:
- `../approach_2_reference/notebooks/` - 25 notebooks
- All S_N hierarchy results
- Extensive geometric visualizations

(Detailed validation methodology to be added)
