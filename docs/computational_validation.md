# Computational Validation

**Status**: Planned (9 focused notebooks, in development)

## Validation Strategy

LRT's computational validation focuses on verifying derivations and testable predictions, not exhaustive exploration (see Approach 2 archive for that).

## Planned Notebook Suite (9 notebooks)

**Aligned with foundational paper structure**:

1. **01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb** - Infinite Information Space, necessity arguments for 3FLL
2. **02_Operator_Formalism.ipynb** - Π_id, {Π_i}, R implementation in ℋ
3. **03_Time_Emergence.ipynb** - Stone's theorem demonstration, unitary evolution
4. **04_Energy_Derivation.ipynb** - Spohn's inequality, entropy-energy relation
5. **05_Russell_Paradox.ipynb** - NC filtering, restricted comprehension emergence
6. **06_Quantum_Superposition.ipynb** - Partial constraint (Id + NC, not EM)
7. **07_Measurement_Collapse.ipynb** - Full constraint (Id + NC + EM)
8. **08_Beta_Prediction.ipynb** - QEC entropy correlation simulation
9. **09_Comparative_Analysis.ipynb** - LRT vs. MUH, pancomputationalism, structural realism

**Total**: ~42,000 words (vs. 80,000 in Approach 2's 25 notebooks)

**Reduction**: 64% fewer notebooks, focused on core derivations and primary prediction

## Notebook Standards

**From CLAUDE.md**:
- 3-line copyright format (JD Longmire, Apache 2.0, citation)
- Professional tone (no thinking commentary, no self-corrections)
- Self-contained (imports, explanations, results in single file)
- References foundational paper sections
- Cross-references Lean formalization where applicable

## Approach 2 Reference Archive

For comprehensive computational exploration (proof of concept that LRT builds on):
- `../approach_2_reference/notebooks/` - 25 notebooks, ~80,000 words
- Complete S_N hierarchy analysis (K(N) = N-2 derivation)
- Permutohedron geometry visualizations
- Finite-N quantum corrections (~10^-8 effects)
- Extensive worked examples (N=3,4,5,6)

LRT notebooks reference Approach 2 results without duplicating exploratory work.

See: `../notebooks/README.md` for current development status
