## PRIMARY TESTABLE PREDICTION: Œ≤ ‚â† 0 in Quantum Error Correction

**Status**: TESTABLE ON CURRENT NISQ HARDWARE

### The Prediction

LRT predicts Œ≤ > 0 in the entropy-conditioned error scaling model:

**Statistical Model**:
```
log p_log = Œ± + Œ≥(d) + Œ∑ log p_phys + Œ≤ ŒîS_sys + Œ£_j Œ∏_j C_j
```

Where:
- **p_log**: Logical error rate
- **ŒîS_sys**: Change in von Neumann entropy (S(œÅ_out) - S(œÅ_in))
- **Œ≤**: Constraint-relaxation coupling constant (KEY LRT PARAMETER)

**Null Hypothesis**: Œ≤ = 0 (standard decoherence-only theory)
**LRT Prediction**: Œ≤ > 0, expected Œ≤ ~ 0.1-0.5

### Experimental Protocol (Summary)

**From foundational paper Section 5.3**:

1. **Low-Entropy Sequence**: Unitary gates (Clifford operations), ŒîS ‚âà 0, duration T
2. **High-Entropy Sequence**: Measurement-reset cycles, ŒîS > 0, identical duration T
3. **Control for confounds**: Gate duration, SPAM, leakage, thermal drift
4. **Test across**: d = 3, 5, 7 code distances; multiple qubit modalities (superconducting, trapped ion, topological)
5. **Success criterion**: Œ≤ > 0 with p < 0.01 across ‚â•2 modalities and ‚â•2 code distances

**Sample size**: 10^4 - 10^5 gate cycles for statistical power ‚â• 0.8

### Theoretical Interpretation

**Œ≤ quantifies constraint relaxation per bit of entropy**:
- Entropy increase (ŒîS > 0) = drift from constrained ùíú toward unconstrained I
- This manifests as errors even when decoherence (T‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÇ) is controlled
- Œ≤ measures strength of constraint-error coupling

**Distinctive signature**: Standard QEC predicts errors scale with decoherence time regardless of operation type. LRT predicts measurably higher error rates for high-entropy operations even when decoherence is controlled.

### Why This Matters

**Device-independent validation**: Œ≤ ‚â† 0 would provide empirical evidence that:
1. NC operates as an active constraint requiring enforcement
2. Error mechanisms include constraint-based components beyond pure decoherence
3. Logical consistency has measurable physical consequences

See foundational paper Section 5.3 for complete experimental protocol, confound mitigation, and statistical analysis details.

## Additional Predictions (from foundational paper)

1. **Information Dominance at Planck Scale**: Information-theoretic constraints govern physics more fundamentally than energy constraints at Planck scale
2. **No Actualized Contradictions at Any Energy Scale**: NC forbids actualized contradictions regardless of energy (testable at LHC energies)
3. **Constraint-Based Cosmology**: Early universe shows minimal constraint (high entropy), increasing constraint produces structure
4. **Falsification Criteria**:
   - Physical system sustaining true contradiction (not superposition, not error) ‚Üí LRT falsified
   - Information shown to be derivative from non-informational substrate ‚Üí LRT falsified

## Experimental Proposals

Current hardware sufficient for Œ≤ ‚â† 0 testing:
- IBM Quantum (superconducting qubits)
- IonQ / Quantinuum (trapped ion)
- Google Quantum AI (superconducting)
- Microsoft (topological, when available)
