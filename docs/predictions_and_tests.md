# Predictions and Testable Claims

**Status**: Stub (to be developed)

## Primary Prediction: β ≠ 0

**Claim**: Quantum error correction shows entropy correlation in Bell state recovery

**Test**: Measure correlation coefficient β in quantum error correction experiments

**Status**: PRIMARY TESTABLE PREDICTION

See: `../notebooks/08_Beta_Prediction.ipynb` for computational analysis

## Additional Predictions

(To be developed as theory matures)

## Experimental Proposals

(To be added after consultation with experimentalists)
