# Philosophical Foundations

**Status**: See foundational paper for complete treatment

## Primary Reference

For the complete philosophical foundation, see:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 2: Premises of Logic Realism Theory)

## Core Principle: A = L(I)

**Actualization = Logical filtering of Infinite Information**

Where:
- **I**: Infinite Information Space (all possibilities, pre-physical)
- **L**: Logical filtering operators (3FLL: Id, NC, EM)
- **A**: Physical actualization (reality as we observe it)

## Necessity of the 3FLL

The foundational paper (Section 2.4) demonstrates that the 3FLL are **necessary conditions** for reality:

1. **Identity (Id)**: Necessary for **being** (entities must persist)
2. **Non-Contradiction (NC)**: Necessary for **information** (distinction requires incompatible states)
3. **Excluded Middle (EM)**: Necessary for **determinacy** (actualization requires binary resolution)

These are not arbitrary axioms but derived necessities for any possible reality admitting entities, distinctions, and determinate states.

## Key Insights

- **Superposition = Partial Constraint**: Id + NC applied, EM not yet applied
- **Measurement = Full Constraint**: Id + NC + EM applied → collapse to definite outcome
- **Mathematics emerges**: NC filters paradoxes (Russell's) → restricted comprehension
- **Time emerges**: Stone's theorem from identity-preserving evolution
- **Energy emerges**: Spohn's inequality from constraint application
