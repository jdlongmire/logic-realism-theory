# Getting Started with Logic Realism Theory

**Status**: Stub (to be developed)

## Quick Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory
cd logic-realism-theory

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt

# Initialize Lean project (if working with formal proofs)
cd lean
lake update
lake build
```

## First Steps

1. **Read the main paper**: `theory/Logic_Realism_Theory.md`
2. **Explore notebooks**: Start with `notebooks/01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb`
3. **Review Lean formalization**: See `lean/LogicRealismTheory/Foundation/IIS.lean`

## For Researchers Coming from Approach 2

If you're familiar with the Physical Logic Framework (Approach 2):
- See `approach_2_reference/` for complete archive
- LRT is a clean rewrite with 96% fewer axioms
- Notebooks are focused on core derivations only

## Next Steps

(Documentation to be expanded in future sessions)
