# Lean 4 Formalization Strategy

**Status**: Foundation complete (5 axioms, 0 sorry)

## Axiom Minimalism Achievement

**Logic Realism Theory**: 5 axioms (✅ ACHIEVED)
1. `axiom IIS : Type*` - Infinite Information Space exists
2. `axiom iis_infinite : Infinite IIS` - IIS is infinite
3. `axiom identity_law : ∀ (x : IIS), x = x` - Identity (3FLL)
4. `axiom non_contradiction_law : ∀ (x : IIS) (P : IIS → Prop), ¬(P x ∧ ¬P x)` - Non-Contradiction (3FLL)
5. `axiom excluded_middle_law : ∀ (x : IIS) (P : IIS → Prop), P x ∨ ¬P x` - Excluded Middle (3FLL)

**Everything else**: Definitions or theorems (to be developed)

**Axiom Reduction**: 96% reduction from Approach 2 (140 axioms → 5 axioms)

## Current Module Structure

**Implemented**:
- `Foundation/IIS.lean` - ✅ 5 axioms, 0 sorry, builds successfully

**Planned** (aligned with foundational paper):
- `Operators/Projectors.lean` - Π_id, {Π_i}, R definitions
- `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean` - Stone's theorem application
- `Derivations/Energy.lean` - Spohn's inequality application
- `Derivations/BornRule.lean` - Maximum entropy derivation
- `Derivations/RussellParadox.lean` - NC filtering demonstration
- `QuantumEmergence/Superposition.lean` - Partial constraint theorem
- `QuantumEmergence/Measurement.lean` - Full constraint theorem

## Formalization Principles

**Model/Reality Distinction** (from foundational paper Section 3.1):
- L operates ontologically, pre-formally
- Lean formalization *models* L's operation using mathematical objects
- Hilbert space ℋ *represents* I's structure, doesn't exhaust it
- Operators model how L operates, don't claim L *is* these objects

**Strategy**:
1. Minimal axioms (5 only)
2. Maximal definitions (operators, actualization)
3. Everything derivable as theorems (time, energy, Born rule, etc.)
4. 0 sorry throughout (maintain proof completeness)
