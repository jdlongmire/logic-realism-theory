# Lean 4 Formalization Strategy

**Status**: Foundation complete (2 axioms, 3FLL proven, 0 sorry)

## Axiom Minimalism Achievement

**Logic Realism Theory**: 2 axioms (✅ ACHIEVED - ABSOLUTE MINIMUM)
1. `axiom I : Type*` - Infinite Information Space exists
2. `axiom I_infinite : Infinite I` - I is infinite

**3FLL**: PROVEN (not axiomatized!)
- `theorem identity_law` - Proven via `rfl` (Lean's reflexivity)
- `theorem non_contradiction_law` - Proven via `fun h => h.2 h.1`
- `theorem excluded_middle_law` - Proven via `Classical.em`

**L (Logical Operator)**: DEFINITION (structure bundling 3FLL)
```lean
def L : LogicalConstraints I := {
  identity := identity_law
  non_contradiction := non_contradiction_law
  excluded_middle := excluded_middle_law
}
```

**Everything else**: Definitions or theorems (to be developed)

**Axiom Reduction**: 98.6% reduction from Approach 2 (140 axioms → 2 axioms)

## Current Module Structure

**Implemented**:
- `Foundation/IIS.lean` - ✅ 2 axioms, 3FLL proven as theorems, 0 sorry, builds successfully

**Planned** (aligned with foundational paper):
- `Operators/Projectors.lean` - Π_id, {Π_i}, R definitions
- `Derivations/TimeEmergence.lean` - Stone's theorem application
- `Derivations/Energy.lean` - Spohn's inequality application
- `Derivations/BornRule.lean` - Maximum entropy derivation
- `Derivations/RussellParadox.lean` - NC filtering demonstration
- `QuantumEmergence/Superposition.lean` - Partial constraint theorem
- `QuantumEmergence/Measurement.lean` - Full constraint theorem

## Formalization Principles

**Model/Reality Distinction** (from foundational paper Section 3.1):
- L operates ontologically, pre-formally
- Lean formalization *models* L's operation using mathematical objects
- Hilbert space ℋ *represents* I's structure, doesn't exhaust it
- Operators model how L operates, don't claim L *is* these objects

**Strategy**:
1. Minimal axioms (5 only)
2. Maximal definitions (operators, actualization)
3. Everything derivable as theorems (time, energy, Born rule, etc.)
4. 0 sorry throughout (maintain proof completeness)
