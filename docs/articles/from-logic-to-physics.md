Here's a strange fact: across all of experimental science, no laboratory has ever recorded a genuine contradiction.

Not once. Not a single detector that registered "triggered" and "not triggered" at the same moment, in the same respect. Not a single measurement log with "yes" and "no" simultaneously. For over a century of precision physics (quantum mechanics, particle accelerators, gravitational wave detectors), every stable record obeys the same pattern.

This might seem obvious. *Of course* contradictions don't show up in lab notebooks. But here's what makes it interesting: we can *imagine* contradictions. We can *represent* them. Philosophers have spent careers exploring scenarios where something could be both P and not-P. Nature refuses to instantiate them.

**Logic Realism Theory (LRT)** takes this asymmetry seriously.

## The Three Laws

Everyone learns the basic logical laws, usually without much fanfare:

**Identity (Id):** A thing is what it is.
**Non-Contradiction (NC):** Nothing can be both P and not-P at the same time and in the same respect.
**Excluded Middle (EM):** For any well-defined property, either a thing has it or it doesn't.

Collectively, we call these **$L_3$**. Most treat them as rules of reasoning, guidelines for clear thinking. LRT makes a bolder claim: these are constraints on what can *exist*.

---

## The Key Distinction

LRT distinguishes two domains:

**$I_\infty$** is everything representable: every concept, configuration, or description you can construct. This includes contradictions, impossibilities, round squares, and married bachelors. You can *represent* "the electron is both spin-up and spin-down in the z-basis." You just did.

**$A_\Omega$** is the subset of $I_\infty$ that can be *physically instantiated*. These are the configurations that can show up as stable records: detector clicks, measurement outcomes, permanent states.

The claim: $A_\Omega$ = $\{x \in I_\infty : L_3(x)\}$.

Only configurations satisfying the three logical laws can be instantiated. The $L_3$ is a constraint on what reality can *be*.

---

## Why This Matters for Physics

If the $L_3$ constrains what can exist, then physics operates within a pre-shaped space. The question becomes: what does that constraint *require*?

The answer turns out to be substantial. When you work through what Identity demands of physical systems (especially the requirement that outcomes must be "vehicle-invariant," the same regardless of how you describe them), you get specific structures:

- **The Born rule** (the $\lvert\psi\rvert^2$ probability law of quantum mechanics) follows from vehicle-invariance via Gleason's theorem
- **Complex Hilbert space** (not real, not quaternionic) is selected by local tomography requirements
- **The symmetrization postulate** (bosons vs. fermions) follows from Identity applied to indistinguishable particles

These are *derivations*. The $L_3$ generates quantum mechanics.

## It from Bit, Bit from Fit

John Wheeler famously proposed "It from Bit": physical reality emerges from information. LRT accepts this, then asks: where does information come from?

A bit (a distinction between 0 and 1) only exists if there's a fact of the matter about which it is. Without Determinate Identity, there's no such fact. The bit dissolves.

So the complete picture is: **It from Bit, Bit from Fit**. Physical structure (It) emerges from informational structure (Bit), which emerges from logical admissibility (Fit = $L_3$). The three logical laws ground the entire chain.

---

## What This Is Not

LRT treats logic as ontologically real: describing genuine constraints on what can be instantiated.

LRT does not claim to derive *all* of physics from logic. Specific field content, coupling constants, and initial conditions remain empirical. What we derive is the *framework*, the mathematical arena within which physics operates.

LRT is falsifiable. If a laboratory ever produced a stable record instantiating a genuine contradiction (a detector simultaneously registering "yes" and "no" in the same respect) LRT would be refuted. The framework takes empirical risk.

## The Journey Ahead

This is the first article in a series exploring Logic Realism Theory for a broader audience. Future pieces will address:

- **The Instantiation Barrier Explained**: Why some configurations in $I_\infty$ can't cross into $A_\Omega$
- **Why Distinguishability Requires Quantum Mechanics**: The path from Identity to Hilbert space
- **The Born Rule Is Not Optional**: How probability emerges from logical constraint
- **Common Objections to Logic Realism**: Addressing the skeptics

For the full technical treatment, see the [Position Paper](/logic-realism-theory/papers/2026-position-paper/). For concept-by-concept breakdowns, explore [Topics](/logic-realism-theory/topics/).
