# Mathematical Details

**Status**: Stub (to be developed)

## Operator Formalism

- Π_id: Identity projector
- {Π_i}: Incompatibility family
- R: Resolution map

(Rigorous mathematical definitions to be added)

## Key Theorems to be Proved

1. Time emergence (Stone's theorem)
2. Energy constraint (Spohn's inequality)
3. Born rule (maximum entropy)
4. Superposition (partial constraint)
5. Measurement collapse (full constraint)
