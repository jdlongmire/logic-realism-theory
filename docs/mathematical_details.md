## Operator-Algebraic Structure

From foundational paper (Section 3.3):

**Identity (Œ†_id)**: Persistence projector on Hilbert space ‚Ñã
- Projects onto paths maintaining coherent identity relations
- Ensures causal continuity and conservation laws
- Œ†_id(Œ≥) = Œ≥ iff Œ≥(s) and Œ≥(t) represent same entity under unitary evolution

**Non-Contradiction ({Œ†_i})**: Incompatibility projector family
- Each Œ†_i corresponds to a determinate state/property
- Orthogonality condition: Œ†_i Œ†_j = 0 for incompatible i ‚â† j
- Enforces that mutually exclusive states cannot be simultaneously actualized

**Excluded Middle (R)**: Resolution map / Booleanization functor
- R: {Œ†_i} ‚Üí {0,1} subject to Œ£_i R(Œ†_i) = 1
- Forces binary resolution (measurement/interaction)
- Category-theoretic: Right adjoint to Bool ‚Üí Heyt inclusion

**Composition**: L = EM ‚àò NC ‚àò Id (right-to-left application)
- Id: ‚Ñã ‚Üí ‚Ñã_Id (restrict to persistent entities)
- NC: ‚Ñã_Id ‚Üí ‚Ñã_NC (exclude incompatible states)
- EM: ‚Ñã_NC ‚Üí ùíú (force binary resolution)

## Explicit Derivations (from foundational paper)

1. **Time Emergence** (Section 3.4): Stone's theorem applied to identity-preserving evolution ‚Üí U(t) = e^(-iHt/‚Ñè)
2. **Energy** (Section 3.4): Spohn's inequality relating entropy production to energy dissipation
3. **Russell's Paradox** (Section 3.4): NC excludes R = {x | x ‚àâ x} from ùíú ‚Üí mathematics has restricted comprehension
4. **Superposition**: Id + NC applied, EM not yet applied (partial constraint)
5. **Measurement**: Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) ‚Üí collapse to definite outcome
