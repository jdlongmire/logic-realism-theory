    "abstract": "Every physical measurement ever conducted has yielded exactly one outcome: self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. This holds across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry, including a century of quantum mechanics where violations were actively sought. This paper argues that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle) are not cognitive conventions but ontological constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability. From this thesis, quantum mechanics emerges as the unique stable structure at the interface between non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality. The framework derives rather than postulates: complex Hilbert space structure follows from interface constraints combined with the physical requirement of compositional consistency (local tomography); the Born rule follows from Gleason's theorem; unitary dynamics follows from information preservation requirements.",
