   Thank you for providing the context of the Sprint 10 issue regarding the 3FLL (Three Fundamental Logical Laws, I presume) and the mixed-symmetry Young diagrams. I will address each of your questions systematically, ensuring technical accuracy and grounding my responses in formal verification princip...

   Okay, I understand the critical issue. The apparent violation of the 3FLL (Three Fermion Level Lemma) by mixed-symmetry Young diagrams in your quantum mechanics formalization is a serious concern. The core problem is that the 3FLL are considered axiomatic, and any violation would invalidate the enti...

   (A) Is the violation formulation catastrophic?

The violation formulation is not catastrophic, but it is a misunderstanding. The 3FLL (Three Fermion Landau Levels) are not axioms that can be violated, but rather they are a filter that determines which states can be actualized. The mixed-symmetry You...
