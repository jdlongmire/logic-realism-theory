# Multi-LLM Team Consultation Request
## Topic: Quantum Simulation Approach - Statistical vs Physical Control

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Requestor**: Claude Code (Session 2.4)
**Urgency**: Medium (blocks validation progress)
**Estimated Review Time**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Context

We're testing LRT's prediction that quantum error rates correlate with entropy changes:
- **Prediction**: `log(p_log) = α + β*ΔS` with β > 0
- **Expected**: β ~ 0.1-0.5

**Initial Result**: β = 56.98 (100x-500x too large)

**Root Cause Analysis**: Duration confound identified
- Low-entropy sequences: 4.350 μs
- High-entropy sequences: 9.400 μs
- Mismatch: 5.050 μs → 2.16x more decoherence

**Hypothesis**: β absorbs duration-dependent decoherence effect.

## The Decision Point

### Option A: Statistical Control (Proposed)

**Approach**: Add duration as control variable in regression

```python
# Record duration alongside other measurements
data = []
for trial in trials:
    qc = create_sequence(...)  # Low or high entropy
    Delta_S = measure_entropy_change(qc)
    p_log = measure_error_rate(qc)
    t = calculate_duration(qc)  # NEW: Record duration

    data.append({'Delta_S': Delta_S, 'p_log': p_log, 't': t})

# Multivariate regression
log(p_log) = α + β*ΔS + θ*t + ε

# Extract β (should drop to ~0.1-0.5)
# θ should be large (confirms duration matters)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to implement (~2-4 hours)
- ✅ Uses existing infrastructure
- ✅ Directly tests hypothesis (duration confound)
- ✅ No delay gate compatibility issues
- ✅ Statistical approach is standard in experimental physics

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't eliminate confound physically
- ❌ Relies on statistical model assumptions
- ❌ Correlation (ΔS, t) may cause multicollinearity
- ❌ May not fully isolate β if other confounds exist

**Confidence**: 70-80%

### Option B: Physical Duration Matching (Original Plan)

**Approach**: Add idle gates to equalize circuit durations

```python
# Calculate durations
t_low = duration(low_entropy_circuit)
t_high = duration(high_entropy_circuit)

# Add idle time to shorter circuit
if t_low < t_high:
    add_idle_gates(low_entropy_circuit, t_high - t_low)

# Now both have same duration → no decoherence confound
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Eliminates confound physically (cleaner)
- ✅ Matches experimental best practices
- ✅ No multicollinearity issues
- ✅ More convincing to experimentalists

**Cons**:
- ❌ Delay gates break entropy calculation (discovered)
- ❌ Requires QEC sequence redesign
- ❌ More complex implementation (2-3 weeks)
- ❌ Risk of introducing new artifacts

**Confidence**: 60-70% (higher uncertainty due to complexity)

## Specific Questions for Team

### Question 1: Approach Selection
**Which approach do you recommend and why?**
- Statistical control (Option A)
- Physical duration matching (Option B)
- Hybrid approach
- Alternative we haven't considered

Consider:
- Time constraints (Option A: hours, Option B: weeks)
- Scientific rigor requirements
- Risk of additional issues
- Publishability/credibility

### Question 2: Statistical Control Validity
**If we use statistical control, is this approach sound?**

Concerns:
1. **Multicollinearity**: ΔS and t are correlated (high ΔS → longer t due to measurement/reset)
   - Will this prevent proper β estimation?
   - Can we trust separate coefficients?

2. **Causality**: We're controlling for t statistically, but:
   - Duration causes decoherence (causal)
   - ΔS and duration are coupled by design (structural)
   - Can regression disentangle these?

3. **Model Specification**: Are we missing other confounds?
   - Qubit count (3 vs 5)
   - Gate count variations
   - Measurement artifacts

### Question 3: Entropy Sequence Design
**We discovered "high-entropy" sequences have LOWER ΔS. What's wrong?**

Current sequences:
- **Low-entropy**: Unitary gates (H, S, CNOT) on 3 qubits
  - Measured ΔS = 0.188 nats
- **High-entropy**: Measurement + reset on 5 qubits
  - Measured ΔS = 0.158 nats (LOWER!)

Expected: High-entropy should have higher ΔS.

Questions:
- Is our understanding of "entropy manipulation" flawed?
- Does measurement/reset REDUCE entropy (projection)?
- Should we measure subsystem entropy instead of total?
- What's the correct way to create varying entropy states?

### Question 4: Delay Gate Issue
**Why do delay gates break entropy calculation?**

Observed behavior:
- Base circuit (no delay): ΔS = 0.188 ✓
- With delay gates added: ΔS = 0.000 ✗

Technical details:
- Using Qiskit 2.x AerSimulator (density_matrix method)
- Delay instruction: `qc.delay(time, qubit, unit='s')`
- Density matrix save: `qc.save_density_matrix()`

Hypothesis:
- Delay gates aren't compatible with density_matrix save?
- Timing simulation issue?
- Bug in Qiskit?

Alternative:
- Use idle gates (explicit identity operations) instead?
- Different simulation method?

### Question 5: Priority
**What should we fix FIRST to unblock progress?**

Issues identified:
1. Duration confound (5.050 μs mismatch)
2. Entropy calculation (partial - works for some sequences)
3. Qubit count mismatch (3 vs 5)
4. Sequence design (ΔS backwards)
5. Delay gate incompatibility

Which is blocking? Which can wait?

## Additional Context

### Paper's Model (Full)
```
log p_log = α + γ(d) + η log p_phys + β ΔS_sys + Σ θ_j C_j + ε
```

where:
- d = code distance
- p_phys = physical error rate
- ΔS_sys = system entropy change
- C_j = control variables (gate time, SPAM, etc.)

Our simplified model (current):
```
log p_log = α + β ΔS
```

Missing terms likely contribute to β inflation.
