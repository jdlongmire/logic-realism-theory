## Abstract and Core Claims

Logic Realism Model (LRM) / Logic Field Theory (LFT) proposes that physical reality emerges from
logical filtering of information, formalized as **A = L(I)** where:
- **A**: Physical actuality (observable states)
- **L**: Logical consistency operator (Identity ∧ Non-Contradiction ∧ Excluded Middle)
- **I**: Information space (directed graphs on N elements)

**Central Thesis**: Quantum mechanics is not fundamental but emerges from maximum entropy
distributions on logically constrained combinatorial structures (permutation space).

## Key Mathematical Results

### Theorem 5.1 (Born Rule Derivation)
The Born rule probability P(s) = |⟨ψ|s⟩|² is uniquely determined by:
1. Maximum entropy principle (least informative distribution)
2. Unitary invariance (all orthonormal bases equivalent)
3. Constraint threshold K(N) = N-2

Proof establishes: max S[ρ] subject to Tr(ρ) = 1 and unitary invariance
yields ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| with squared-amplitude probabilities.

### Theorem 6.1 (Lagrangian-Hamiltonian Duality)
Minimal action principle is equivalent to minimal Fisher information:

∫ L dt = min  ⟺  ∫ I_F dt = min

where I_F is Fisher information metric on constrained permutation space V_K.

### K(N) = N-2 Constraint Threshold
Proven via three independent approaches:
1. **Mahonian statistics**: Inversion count distribution symmetry
2. **Coxeter braid relations**: Simple transpositions generate S_N with (N-2) constraints
3. **Maximum entropy**: Unique constraint level preserving continuous symmetry

## Physical System Mapping

The framework provides explicit mapping to standard quantum systems:

| System | Information Space | Constraint K | Observable |
|--------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Interferometry | Path orderings | N-2 | Phase difference |
| Qubit | 2-element permutations | 0 | Bloch sphere state |
| Energy levels | State orderings | N-2 | Energy eigenvalues |

## Computational Validation

Tested for N=3 to N=8 systems:
- ✓ Born rule probabilities match analytical predictions to machine precision
- ✓ Fisher metric equals Fubini-Study metric (7/7 properties verified for N=3)
- ✓ Hamiltonian dynamics emerge from Laplace-Beltrami operator
- ✓ K(N) = N-2 threshold verified across all tested values

## Experimental Predictions (from Notebooks 09-11)

### Finite-N Quantum Corrections
1. **Permutohedron discretization**: ~10^-30 modifications to Born rule at N=10^10
2. **Constraint oscillations**: ΔP/P ~ 10^-8 near boundaries
3. **Mode coupling**: Cross-frequency effects in N<100 systems
4. **Entropy floor**: S_min > 0 at maximum constraint
5. **Metastable transitions**: Discrete jumps in finite systems

### Spectral Signatures
6. **Graph Laplacian eigenspectrum**: Distinct from continuous manifolds
7. **Permutohedron resonances**: Algebraic frequency relations
8. **Constraint-dependent dispersion**: ω(k,K) non-trivial
9. **Topological phase indicators**: Homotopy classes affect spectrum
10. **Finite-size thermalization**: Different ETH scaling

### Entropy Saturation & Page Curve
11. **Page curve emergence**: S(t) matches black hole information paradox structure
12. **Constraint-dependent saturation**: S_max = f(N,K)
13. **Scrambling time scaling**: t* ~ N log N for permutohedron
14. **ETH modifications**: Eigenstate thermalization with finite-N corrections
15. **Information retention**: Non-Markovian effects in small systems

- Does this provide new insights into quantum foundations?
- Are the 15 experimental predictions sufficiently distinct from standard QM to be meaningful?
- How does this compare to other derivations of the Born rule (Gleason, Deutsch, etc.)?

### 4. Clarity and Presentation
- Is the logical flow clear and accessible to physicists?
- Are key assumptions stated explicitly?
- Is the mathematical notation consistent and well-defined?
- Are there areas that need clarification or expansion?

### 5. Potential Weaknesses
- What are the strongest objections or criticisms?
- Where are the theoretical or experimental vulnerabilities?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What follow-up work is most critical?

### 6. Experimental Feasibility
- Which of the 15 predictions are most experimentally accessible?
