1. EPISTEMIC FRAMING VALIDITY:
   The epistemic vs ontic distinction for indistinguishability is rigorous and defensible within the context of quantum foundations. This framing aligns with information-theoretic and relational interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM), where q...

1. EPISTEMIC FRAMING VALIDITY:
   [Yes, the epistemic vs ontic distinction is rigorous and defensible for indistinguishability. It provides a valuable perspective on the symmetrization postulate and avoids the contradictions inherent in the ontic interpretation.]

1. EPISTEMIC FRAMING VALIDITY:
   The epistemic vs ontic distinction is indeed rigorous for indistinguishability. It is a well-established concept in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, where the state of a system is often described in terms of the information avail...
