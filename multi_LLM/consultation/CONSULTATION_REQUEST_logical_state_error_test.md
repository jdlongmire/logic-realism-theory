# Multi-LLM Consultation Request: "Logical State-Dependent Error" Test Design

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Session**: 2.6 (Second design iteration)
**Requestor**: Claude Code (Session Lead)
**Phase**: 1 - Final Design Validation Before Implementation

---

## Context

**Previous Design ("No Actualized Contradictions"):**
- Quality Score: 0.68 (Grok 0.77, ChatGPT 0.65, Gemini 0.62)
- **Fatal Flaw Identified:** Doesn't differentiate LRT from QM
- **Unanimous Finding:** "Contradiction circuit" definition ambiguous
- **Result:** Abandoned before coding (design-first methodology working)

**Root Cause Analysis (Gemini's Insight):**
> "Any test comparing two different circuits is likely doomed."

**Why:** Circuit A vs Circuit B comparison introduces structural confounds (duration, gates, noise) causing perfect multicollinearity (VIF = ∞).

**New Approach (Based on Gemini's Recommendations):**
- Single circuit with parameter variation
- Residual analysis: Compare measurement vs QM baseline prediction
- Isolate LRT effect AFTER accounting for known physics

## The New Test Design

**Full Design Document**: `theory/Logical_State_Dependent_Error_Test_Design.md`

### Core Hypothesis

**LRT Claim:** Superposition (EM relaxed) is logically less stable than classical state (EM enforced)

**Prediction:** Superposition should exhibit excess error beyond T2 decoherence

**Statistical Test:**
```
p_log(B) = p_T2 (baseline) + p_LRT (excess) + ε

H0: p_LRT = 0 (standard QM)
H1: p_LRT > 0 (LRT)
```

### Experimental Protocol

**Experiment A (Classical State - Baseline):**
1. Initialize |0⟩
2. Apply identity-equivalent gates for duration T
3. Measure in Z-basis
4. Result: p_log(A) ≈ p_T1 (amplitude damping)

**Experiment B (Superposition State - Test):**
1. Initialize |+⟩
2. Apply **IDENTICAL** gates for duration T
3. Measure in X-basis
4. Result: p_log(B) = p_T2 + p_LRT (if LRT correct)

**Key Feature:** SAME circuit for both experiments
- Same gates
- Same duration T
- Only differences: Initial state and measurement basis

### Statistical Model (Residual Analysis)

**Step 1:** Characterize T1, T2 independently (standard protocols)

**Step 2:** Predict error rate from baseline
```
p_log(B)_predicted = (1 - exp(-T/T2)) / 2
```

**Step 3:** Calculate residual
```
Δp(T) = p_log(B)_observed - p_log(B)_predicted
```

**Step 4:** Test if residual is significant
```
Regression: Δp(T) = β_LRT * T + ε

H0: β_LRT = 0
H1: β_LRT > 0
```

### Why Multicollinearity is Avoided

**NOT comparing:** Circuit A vs Circuit B (this causes VIF = ∞)

**COMPARING:** Measurement vs Prediction
- Only predictor: T (duration)
- No circuit indicator variable
- **VIF = 1** (by definition for single predictor)

**Proof:**
```
For single-predictor regression:
VIF = 1 / (1 - R²) where R² is from regressing predictor on itself
VIF = 1 (always)
```

### Confounds Identified (5, All Measurable)

1. **T1/T2 measurement uncertainty**
   - Mitigation: Large sample sizes, uncertainty propagation

2. **Pulse imperfections**
   - Mitigation: Randomized benchmarking, include F_avg in model

3. **Measurement basis calibration**
   - Mitigation: Process tomography, test in Y-basis as well

4. **State preparation errors**
   - Mitigation: Active cooling, tomography

5. **Environmental noise drift**
   - Mitigation: Interleave measurements, monitor T1/T2 vs time

### Power Analysis

**Setup:**
- Expected effect: p_LRT ~ 0.01-0.10 (1-10% excess error)
- Sample size: N = 10,000 per experiment
- Significance: α = 0.05
- Power: 1 - β = 0.80

**Result:**
```
Standard error: σ_Δp = 0.005 (0.5%)
95% CI half-width: 0.01 (1%)
Minimum detectable: p_LRT ≥ 0.01 (1% excess error)
```

**Conclusion:** N=10,000 sufficient for small effect detection

## Critical Questions for Team

### Question 1: Is the residual analysis methodology sound?

**Specific concerns:**
- Is comparing measurement vs prediction scientifically valid?
- Does this truly avoid multicollinearity, or is there a hidden confound?
- Are we correctly isolating the LRT effect from known physics?

**Sub-question:** Can we trust baseline T1/T2 characterization to be accurate enough for residual analysis?

### Question 2: Does this design differentiate LRT from QM?

**Unlike the contradiction test:**
- QM predicts: p_LRT = 0 (no excess error beyond T2)
- LRT predicts: p_LRT > 0 (logical instability creates excess)

**Request:** Is this a CLEAR falsifiable difference?
- If p_LRT > 0: Strong evidence for LRT?
- If p_LRT = 0: Rules out LRT's "logical instability" claim?

### Question 3: Are there confounds we're still missing?

**Identified confounds:** 5 (all measurable)

**Request:** Are there OTHER confounds specific to residual analysis?
- Systematic errors in baseline characterization?
- Correlations between T1/T2 measurement and Experiment B?
- Hidden dependencies we haven't considered?

### Question 4: Is the statistical model correctly specified?

**Current model:**
```
Δp(T) = β_LRT * T + ε
```

**Assumptions:**
- Linear relationship between p_LRT and T
- Normal errors
- Independent measurements

**Request:** Should we use a different functional form?
- Exponential: Δp = k * (1 - exp(-T/τ_LRT))
- Power law: Δp = k * T^n
- Non-parametric approach?

### Question 5: How do we interpret a positive result?

**Challenge:** Even if p_LRT > 0, could it be something OTHER than LRT's "logical instability"?

**Alternative explanations:**
- Unknown systematic error in T2 measurement
- Qubit-specific effect (not fundamental)
- Measurement basis artifacts

**Request:** What additional tests would rule out alternatives?
