# FOCUSED PEER REVIEW: Logic Realism Model / Logic Field Theory

## Core Claim
Quantum mechanics emerges from maximum entropy on logically constrained permutation space.
Mathematical formulation: **A = L(I)** where A is physical actuality, L is logical consistency operator, I is information space.

## Key Results to Review

### 1. Born Rule Derivation (Theorem 5.1)
**Claim**: P(s) = |⟨ψ|s⟩|² uniquely determined by:
- Maximum entropy principle
- Unitary invariance
- Constraint threshold K(N) = N-2

**Question**: Is this derivation rigorous? Does it avoid circularity (assuming quantum structure to derive quantum structure)?

### 2. Constraint Threshold K(N) = N-2
**Claim**: Proven via three independent approaches:
- Mahonian statistics (inversion count symmetry)
- Coxeter braid relations (simple transpositions)
- Maximum entropy (continuous symmetry preservation)

**Question**: Are these truly independent proofs, or do they rely on the same underlying assumptions?

### 3. Fisher Metric = Fubini-Study Metric
**Claim**: Fisher information metric on constrained permutation space V_K equals the Fubini-Study metric of quantum mechanics.

**Question**: Is this equivalence exact or approximate? What are the mathematical conditions for this equality?

### 4. Experimental Predictions
15 testable deviations from standard QM for finite-N systems:
- Permutohedron discretization effects (~10^-30 at N=10^10)
- Constraint oscillations (ΔP/P ~ 10^-8)
- Mode coupling in small systems
- Graph Laplacian spectral signatures
- Modified Page curve for entropy

**Question**: Are these predictions:
a) Experimentally accessible with current technology?
b) Distinct enough from standard QM to be meaningful tests?
c) Falsifiable in principle?

## Specific Review Questions

### Mathematical Rigor
1. Does the maximum entropy derivation of the Born rule avoid assuming unitarity (which is itself a quantum concept)?
2. Is the mapping from permutation space to Hilbert space bijective and well-defined?
3. Are there hidden assumptions in the K(N) = N-2 proofs?

### Physical Consistency
4. How does this framework handle measurement? Is collapse emergent or fundamental?
5. What is the ontological status of the "information space"? Is it more fundamental than spacetime?
6. Does this reduce to standard QM in all known regimes?

### Novelty Assessment
7. How does this differ from:
   - Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH)?
   - Deutsch's constructor theory?
   - Other derivations of Born rule (Gleason, Zurek, etc.)?

8. What is the genuine explanatory advance? Does it answer "why quantum mechanics" or just reformulate it?

### Critical Weaknesses
9. What are the 3 strongest objections you can raise?
10. Where is the theory most vulnerable to experimental falsification?
