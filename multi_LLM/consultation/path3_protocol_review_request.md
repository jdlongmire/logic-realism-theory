# Multi-LLM Consultation Request: Path 3 Protocol Review

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Consultation Type**: Protocol Validation
**Subject**: T1 vs T2 Comparison Test (Path 3)
**Requester**: James D. (JD) Longmire
**Priority**: HIGH (clearest remaining LRT test)

---

## Executive Summary

**Request**: Review the complete Path 3 experimental protocol and implementation for testing Logic Realism Theory's prediction that superposition states are fundamentally less stable than classical states.

**Key Hypothesis**:
- **LRT Prediction**: T2 < T1 (superposition decays faster due to relaxed Excluded Middle constraint)
- **QM Prediction**: T2 ≈ T1 (no fundamental state preference)

**Resource Commitment**: ~120 hours quantum time, ~$0-12K (if purchasing), 2-3 months execution

**Critical Decision Point**: Before applying for enhanced IBM Quantum access, we need team validation that:
1. The experimental design is sound
2. Confounds are adequately controlled
3. The prediction difference is clear and falsifiable
4. Resource allocation is justified

## Consultation Questions

### Category 1: Experimental Design Validation

**Q1.1**: Does the T1 vs T2 comparison avoid the logical equivalence trap that blocked Path 2?
- Path 2 problem: A/B circuit comparison introduced logical equivalence
- Path 3 approach: Independent T1 and T2 measurements with distinct predictions
- **Question**: Is this separation sufficient, or are there hidden equivalences?

**Q1.2**: Is the hybrid log-linear duration sweep (49 points, 1-1000 µs) optimal?
- Short-time log spacing (1-100 µs): 24 points for rapid decay
- Long-time linear spacing (100-1000 µs): 25 points for asymptote
- **Question**: Would a different sampling strategy improve statistical power?

**Q1.3**: Are 10,000 shots per point necessary, or could we reduce to 5,000-7,500?
- Target: Detect 10% difference in T2/T1 ratio
- Current precision: ~0.5% per measurement
- **Question**: What's the minimum shot count for 95% power?

### Category 2: LRT Prediction Clarity

**Q2.1**: Is the LRT prediction (T2 < T1) well-justified from the theoretical framework?
- Argument: Superposition |+⟩ has relaxed Excluded Middle (EM) constraint
- Classical |1⟩ has all three constraints (I + NC + EM)
- Relaxed EM → "logically unstable" → faster phase decoherence
- **Question**: Is this derivation sound, or is it hand-waving?

**Q2.2**: What magnitude of T2/T1 deviation does LRT predict?
- Protocol assumes: T2/T1 < 0.9 (at least 10% difference)
- **Question**: Does LRT provide a quantitative prediction, or just qualitative (T2 < T1)?

**Q2.3**: Could standard QM also predict T2 < T1 via some mechanism?
- Known: 1/T2 = 1/(2T1) + 1/T2Φ (pure dephasing)
- Typically: T2 < 2T1 due to finite T2Φ
- **Question**: Is there a QM mechanism that would give T2 < T1 (not just T2 < 2T1)?

### Category 3: Confound Assessment

**Q3.1**: Is T2echo (Hahn echo) measurement adequate for confound control?
- Purpose: Distinguish LRT effect from pure dephasing
- Interpretation: If T2echo ≈ 2T1 but T2 < T1 → QM noise, not LRT
- **Question**: Are there scenarios where T2echo fails to separate LRT from QM?

**Q3.2**: What about hardware drift between T1 and T2 measurements?
- Mitigation: Rapid sequential measurement (<1 hour apart)
- Alternative: Interleaved T1/T2 circuits in single job
- **Question**: Is drift adequately controlled, or should we mandate interleaving?

**Q3.3**: Could measurement fidelity bias the T2/T1 ratio systematically?
- Typical readout errors: 1-5%
- Asymmetric: P(0→1) ≠ P(1→0)
- **Question**: Does readout error cancel in the ratio, or does it bias results?

**Q3.4**: Are there other confounds we missed?
- Protocol identifies: Drift, crosstalk, readout errors, pure dephasing, heating
- **Question**: What confounds are not addressed?

### Category 4: Resource Optimization

**Q4.1**: Do we need 3 backends, or would 1-2 suffice for initial test?
- Justification: Cross-validation, rule out backend-specific artifacts
- Cost: 3× quantum time (120 hours total)
- **Question**: Could we start with 1 backend and expand if signal detected?

**Q4.2**: Could we reduce the number of duration points from 49 to ~25-30?
- Current: 49 points for robust fitting and high df
- Trade-off: Fewer points = faster execution but less statistical power
- **Question**: What's the minimum acceptable number of points?

**Q4.3**: Should we do a pilot test on free tier before enhanced access?
- Pilot: 5-10 points × 1,000 shots (technical validation only)
- Benefit: Test workflow, identify issues
- Cost: No scientific conclusions, but time investment
- **Question**: Is a pilot worth the effort?

### Category 5: Falsification Criteria

**Q5.1**: What would constitute clear evidence FOR LRT?
- Proposed: T2/T1 < 0.9, p < 0.05, consistent across backends, T2echo < T1
- **Question**: Are these criteria sufficient and appropriate?

**Q5.2**: What would constitute clear evidence AGAINST LRT?
- Proposed: T2/T1 ≈ 0.9-1.1, p > 0.05, T2echo ≈ 2T1
- **Question**: Would this definitively rule out LRT, or just this prediction?

**Q5.3**: How do we avoid ambiguous "borderline" results?
- Risk: T2/T1 ≈ 0.85-0.95 (suggestive but not definitive)
- Strategy: Increase precision? Test more backends? Different observable?
- **Question**: What's the plan if results are borderline?

### Category 6: Alternative Approaches

**Q6.1**: Should we test Path 5 (Hamiltonian frequency shift) instead/in addition?
- Path 5 prediction: ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩) (superposition has different energy)
- Advantage: Very high precision (kHz), different observable
- **Question**: Is Path 5 better, or should we do Path 3 first?

**Q6.2**: Could we combine Path 3 and Path 5 in a single experiment?
- Measure T1, T2, and frequency shift simultaneously
- **Question**: Would this increase efficiency or complicate analysis?

## Specific Technical Questions

### Circuit Design

**T1 Circuit**: `|0⟩ → X → delay(T) → Measure`
- **Question**: Is this the standard T1 measurement, or are there better variants?

**T2 Circuit**: `|0⟩ → H → delay(T) → H → Measure`
- **Question**: Should we use Ramsey with detuning, or is this simpler version adequate?

**T2echo Circuit**: `|0⟩ → H → delay(T/2) → X → delay(T/2) → H → Measure`
- **Question**: Should the refocusing pulse be X or Y? Does it matter?

### Analysis Pipeline

**T1 Fit**: `P_1(T) = exp(-T/T1)`
- **Question**: Should we include a plateau parameter for residual |1⟩ population?

**T2 Fit**: `P_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + p0`
- **Question**: Is the baseline error model correct, or should we use a different form?

**Hypothesis Test**: One-tailed t-test for T2 < T1
- **Question**: Is parametric test appropriate, or should we use non-parametric (Mann-Whitney)?

## Team Review Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Achieve quality score > 0.70 for protocol confidence

**Specific Goals**:
1. **Validate design**: Confirm T1 vs T2 comparison is scientifically sound
2. **Identify blind spots**: Find confounds or logical issues we missed
3. **Optimize resources**: Reduce quantum time/cost if possible without sacrificing power
4. **Clarify predictions**: Ensure LRT and QM predictions are truly distinct
5. **Set success criteria**: Define clear falsification boundaries

**Decision Gate**:
- If quality score ≥ 0.70 → Proceed with enhanced access application
- If quality score < 0.70 → Revise protocol based on feedback, re-submit

---

## Background Context

### Path 1 Results (Baseline)
- **Test**: T2 decoherence measurement (Ramsey)
- **Result**: No LRT signal detected at 2.8% precision
- **Interpretation**: LRT and QM make identical predictions for absolute T2
- **Lesson**: Need state-dependent comparison (T1 vs T2)

### Path 2 Blocked
- **Test**: Contradiction suppression (A/B circuit comparison)
- **Issue**: Logical equivalence - both circuits represent same physics
- **Lesson**: Avoid A/B comparisons, need truly independent measurements

### Why Path 3?
- **Distinct predictions**: T2 < T1 (LRT) vs T2 ≈ T1 (QM)
- **Standard measurements**: Well-characterized, no novel techniques
- **Few confounds**: Primarily pure dephasing (controlled via T2echo)
- **Clear interpretation**: Ratio T2/T1 is directly meaningful

- No novel physics required
- Clear statistical framework

**Medium Risk**:
- Pure dephasing confound (controlled via T2echo)
- Hardware drift (mitigated via rapid measurement)
- Resource commitment (120 hours)

**High Risk**:
- Ambiguous results (borderline significance)
- LRT and QM predictions may not be as distinct as assumed

## Appendix: Quick Reference

**LRT Framework**:
- A = L(I) where L = I ∧ NC ∧ EM
- Classical states: All three constraints active
- Superposition states: EM relaxed (incomplete specification)
- Prediction: Relaxed EM → faster decoherence

**Standard QM**:
- 1/T2 = 1/(2T1) + 1/T2Φ
- T2 ≤ 2T1 (hard bound)
- No fundamental preference for state type
- T2/T1 ratio varies with noise environment, not state

**Key Distinction**: LRT predicts systematic T2 < T1 due to logical status, QM predicts no such systematic preference.
