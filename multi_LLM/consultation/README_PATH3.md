## Consultation Questions (Summary)

### Category 1: Experimental Design (3 questions)
- Q1.1: Does T1 vs T2 avoid logical equivalence trap?
- Q1.2: Is 49-point hybrid log-linear sweep optimal?
- Q1.3: Are 10,000 shots per point necessary?

### Category 2: LRT Prediction Clarity (3 questions)
- Q2.1: Is T2 < T1 prediction well-justified from theory?
- Q2.2: What magnitude does LRT predict (quantitative)?
- Q2.3: Could QM also predict T2 < T1?

### Category 3: Confound Assessment (4 questions)
- Q3.1: Is T2echo adequate for confound control?
- Q3.2: Hardware drift mitigation sufficient?
- Q3.3: Measurement fidelity bias in ratio?
- Q3.4: Other confounds missed?

### Category 4: Resource Optimization (3 questions)
- Q4.1: Need 3 backends or start with 1-2?
- Q4.2: Can we reduce from 49 to 25-30 points?
- Q4.3: Worth doing pilot test on free tier?

### Category 5: Falsification Criteria (3 questions)
- Q5.1: What constitutes clear evidence FOR LRT?
- Q5.2: What constitutes clear evidence AGAINST LRT?
- Q5.3: How to avoid ambiguous borderline results?

### Category 6: Alternative Approaches (2 questions)

## Expected Team Review

**From Each LLM** (Grok-3, GPT-4, Gemini-2.0):
1. Overall Assessment (Score 0-1)
2. Critical Issues
3. Suggested Improvements
4. Resource Assessment
5. Prediction Clarity
6. Go/No-Go Recommendation

**Consolidated Report**:
- Average quality score
- Consensus on critical issues
- Ranked improvements
- Clear go/no-go decision

---

## Decision Criteria

**Quality Score ≥ 0.70**:
- ✅ Proceed with enhanced IBM Quantum access application
- Request 120 hours for 3-backend cross-validation
- Begin pilot test (optional)
- Prepare for full execution

**Quality Score < 0.70**:
- ❌ Revise protocol based on feedback
- Address critical issues
- Re-submit for consultation
- Do not apply for enhanced access yet

---

## Resource Commitment

**If Approved**:
- **Quantum Time**: ~120 hours (3 backends × 40 hours)
- **Cost**: $0 (if enhanced access approved) or ~$12K (if purchasing)
- **Duration**: 2-3 months (application → execution → analysis → publication)
- **Personnel**: ~1-2 FTE months

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- Validated methodology (Path 1 baseline)
- Standard measurements
- Clear falsification criteria
- But: Significant resource commitment

---

## Timeline

## Notes

**Important**: This consultation is critical. We're asking for ~120 hours of quantum time (either free via enhanced access, or ~$12K if purchasing). The team review ensures:
1. The experimental design is scientifically sound
2. LRT and QM predictions are truly distinct
3. Confounds are adequately controlled
4. Resources are appropriately allocated
5. Success/failure criteria are clear

**Do not skip this step**. Even with validated methodology from Path 1, Path 3 is a different experiment with new challenges. Team validation is essential.
