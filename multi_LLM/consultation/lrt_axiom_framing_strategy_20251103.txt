Topic: LRT Axiom Count Framing Strategy
Type: Strategic Decision - Theory Presentation

=== CONTEXT ===

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) is being prepared for peer review. A critical question has emerged: How should we count and present the theory's axioms?

Currently, the Lean 4 formalization contains 57 axiom declarations (after removing duplicates/false positives). These are classified as:
- K_math: 16 (mathematical infrastructure - Stone's theorem, spectral theorem, etc.)
- LRT_foundational: 14 (core theory postulates)
- Measurement_dynamics: 15 (measurement mechanism properties)
- Computational_helper: 4 (function definitions)
- Physical_postulate: 1 (energy additivity)
- Placeholder: 5 (temporary markers to be replaced)

=== COMPARISON DATA ===

Other quantum mechanics reconstruction programs report:

Hardy (2001): 5 axioms
- Probabilities, simplicity, subspaces, composite systems, continuity
- From these, derives full QM formalism

Chiribella, D'Ariano, Perinotti (2011): 6 axioms
- Causality, distinguishability, compression, local distinguishability, pure conditioning, purification
- From these, derives full QM formalism

Dakic & Brukner (2009): 3-4 axioms
- Limited information, reversible dynamics, tomographic locality (+ subspace)
- From these, derives full QM formalism

Standard QM (Dirac-von Neumann): 4-5 postulates
- Hilbert space, observables, Born rule, unitary evolution, composition
- Postulates the formalism directly

All of these approaches use the same ~16 mathematical infrastructure results (Stone's theorem, spectral theorem, etc.) but don't count them as "theory axioms."

=== LRT'S CURRENT SITUATION ===

LRT's core ontological claim:
1. Infinite Information Space (I) exists
2. I is infinite
3. Actualization A = L(I) reduces entropy (via logical constraints)

From this core, LRT claims to DERIVE:
- Time emergence from Identity constraint
- Hilbert space structure from constraint geometry
- Complex field from phase continuity + compositionality
- Hermitian operators from constraint operators
- Born rule from MaxEnt + Non-Contradiction
- Classical emergence at K=0

However, in the current Lean code:
- "time_emergence_from_identity" is marked as 'axiom' (not proven theorem)
- "hilbert_space_from_constraints" is marked as 'axiom' (not proven theorem)
- "born_rule_from_measurement" is marked as 'axiom' (not proven theorem)
- "observables_from_constraint_operators" is marked as 'axiom' (not proven theorem)

Some of these HAVE derivations in the paper (Main.md), but not formalized proofs in Lean.

=== THREE FRAMING OPTIONS ===

OPTION A: Bold Reframing - "2-3 Core Axioms"
Claim: "LRT has 2-3 core ontological axioms and derives the quantum formalism"
Count: 2-3 axioms (I exists, I infinite, A = L(I))
Status of derivations: Would need to convert current 'axiom' declarations to proven 'theorem' declarations
Peer review risk: If derivation gaps remain, major credibility issue
Competitive advantage: Matches or beats Hardy/Chiribella/Dakic in axiom count

OPTION B: Honest Accounting - "~20-25 Theory Axioms"
Claim: "LRT has ~20-25 theory axioms (excluding mathematical infrastructure)"
Count: 14 foundational + 1 physical + ~8-10 measurement (after reduction)
Status: Acknowledge some "derivations" are currently postulated
Peer review risk: Low - very honest, but looks less competitive
Competitive advantage: Still shows LRT derives what others postulate (Born rule, Hilbert space)

OPTION C: Staged Approach - "Work in Progress Toward 2-3 Core"
Claim: "LRT currently has X axioms, with clear path to 2-3 core + derivations"
Count: Transparent about current 30 axioms, roadmap to reduce
Status: Explicitly acknowledge formalization is incomplete but derivations exist in paper
Peer review risk: Medium - honest about incompleteness but shows clear direction
Competitive advantage: Shows ambition while maintaining credibility

=== THE VERIFICATION QUESTION ===

Key question: What counts as a "derivation" vs. an "axiom"?

Example from current code:
```lean
-- In MeasurementGeometry.lean:
axiom hilbert_space_from_constraints :
  "Hilbert space emerges from constraint structure"
```

Is this:
A) An axiom (we postulate Hilbert space emerges)
B) A placeholder for a derivation that exists in the paper but isn't formalized yet
C) A theorem that should be provable from I + A=L(I) + constraint dynamics

Similar questions apply to:
- Time emergence
- Born rule
- Complex field forcing
- Observable/Hermitian connection
- Many measurement properties

=== REQUEST TO LLM TEAM ===

Please analyze this situation and provide your assessment on:

1. What is the HONEST axiom count for LRT as currently formalized?
   - Should we count only ontological primitives (2-3)?
   - Should we count all 'axiom' declarations (57)?
   - Should we count theory axioms vs. infrastructure separately?

2. Which framing option (A, B, or C) is most appropriate given:
   - Current state of formalization
   - Standard practices in QM reconstruction field
   - Peer review expectations
   - Risk vs. reward tradeoffs

3. What work would be required to honestly claim Option A (2-3 axioms)?
   - Which current axioms are actually derivable?
   - Which are genuinely necessary postulates?
   - Which are definitions or consequences?

4. How do reviewers in quantum foundations typically evaluate axiom counts?
   - Do they count only core principles?
   - Do they count every formal declaration?
   - What's the difference between "axiom" and "definition"?

5. Strategic recommendation:
   - Which option minimizes risk while maintaining competitiveness?
   - What is the most defensible framing?
   - Should we aim for bold reframing or transparent honesty?

=== CONSTRAINTS ===

- Lean code is public on GitHub - any reviewer can count axiom declarations
- Paper claims derivations for Born rule, time emergence, etc.
- Formalization is incomplete - not all paper derivations are in Lean yet
- Sprint 12 has 1-2 weeks to address gaps before peer review submission
- Main.md currently has outdated axiom count (~7) that needs correction

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Please provide:
1. Your analysis of the current situation
2. Assessment of each option's viability
3. Recommendation on framing strategy
4. Any additional considerations we may have missed

Be as critical and honest as needed. This is a strategic decision that will affect how the theory is received by the physics community.
