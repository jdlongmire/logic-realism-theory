# Multi-LLM Team Consultation Request
## Topic: QEC Experimental Design - Fixing Testability Issues

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Requestor**: Claude Code (Session 2.5 continuation)
**Urgency**: High (blocks validation, may require paper revision)
**Estimated Review Time**: 45-60 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

We attempted to test LRT's falsifiable QEC prediction (Section 4 of foundational paper) through three different simulation approaches. **All three revealed fundamental experimental design issues** that prevent proper testing. The paper's protocol (lines 359-377) appears to have conceptual errors and practical impossibilities that need resolution before claiming this is a testable prediction.

**Critical Finding**: The paper claims you can "manipulate ΔS at fixed decoherence times" using "measurement-reset cycles producing ΔS_high > 0" (lines 311, 363). **This is empirically wrong** - measurement-reset REDUCES entropy, not increases it. This invalidates the proposed experimental protocol.

**Status**: Need team expertise to either:
1. Fix the experimental design (revise Section 4)
2. Reframe the prediction to be testable
3. Acknowledge current untestability and propose future directions

## Background: The Prediction

**Paper's Claim** (lines 310-316):
> "If von Neumann entropy change (ΔS) is manipulated at fixed decoherence times (T₁, T₂) and gate durations, LRT predicts β > 0 in the error scaling model below. Decoherence-only frameworks predict β = 0. This provides a falsifiable discriminator testable on current NISQ-era quantum hardware."

**Statistical Model** (line 329):
```
log p_log = α + γ(d) + η log p_phys + β ΔS_sys + Σ_j θ_j C_j
```

Where:
- p_log = logical error rate
- ΔS_sys = S(ρ_out) - S(ρ_in) (von Neumann entropy change)
- β = constraint-relaxation coupling (LRT parameter)

**Null Hypothesis**: β = 0 (standard QEC)
**LRT Prediction**: β > 0 (constraint effects beyond decoherence)
**Expected Magnitude**: β ~ 0.1-0.5 (line 400)

## Three Simulation Attempts: What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Statistical Control with Entropy Sequences

**Implementation**: `statistical_control_simulation.py`

**Design**:
- Low-entropy: Separable states (H on each qubit)
- High-entropy: GHZ states (entangled)
- Statistical control: Multivariate regression with duration

**Result**: **NEGATIVE correlation** (β = -4.03)

**Root Cause**: GHZ state `(|000⟩ + |111⟩)/√2` **IS** a valid logical state in 3-qubit repetition code! The QEC saw:
- GHZ (high-entropy): Valid code state → 4.6% errors (LOW)
- Separable (low-entropy): Invalid code state → 73% errors (HIGH)

**Lesson**: We weren't testing entropy effects on QEC - we were testing whether our circuits preserved the code space.

---

### Attempt 2: Noise Variation

**Implementation**: `noise_variation_simulation.py`

**Design**:
- IDENTICAL circuits for all trials
- Vary noise parameters (T1, T2, gate errors)
- Higher noise → higher ΔS (from decoherence) → higher p_log
- Test if ΔS has independent effect beyond noise

**Results**:
- Simple regression: β = 11.11, p < 0.0001 (looks positive!)
- **With noise controls**: β = -0.0075, p = 0.629 (NOT significant)
- VIF = 11.2 (severe multicollinearity)

**Interpretation**: The entropy-error correlation is **spurious** - it disappears when controlling for noise. ΔS is just a proxy for noise strength, not an independent effect.

**Lesson**: Varying noise to create ΔS variation creates perfect coupling between p_phys and ΔS. Cannot test for independent effect.

---

### Attempt 3: Circuit Structure Test

**Implementation**: `circuit_structure_test.py`

**Design**:
- Fixed noise model (same T1, T2 for all trials)
- Circuit A: Unitary-only (minimal measurements)
- Circuit B: Measurement-heavy (frequent syndrome checks)
- Compare error rates

**Results**:
- Measurement-heavy has 2.45x higher errors (p < 0.0001)
- **Duration confound**: Unitary = 6.1 μs, Measurement = 16.5 μs
- Perfect multicollinearity: Circuit type and duration perfectly correlated
- "Duration-controlled" β is meaningless (θ = -0.0715, nonsensical)

**Lesson**: Different circuit structures have different durations. Cannot match durations without delay gates (which break density matrix simulation). Statistical control fails with perfect multicollinearity.

---

## Fundamental Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Entropy Framing is Empirically Wrong

**Paper's claim** (lines 352-354, 363):
> "Unitary blocks (U): ΔS ≈ 0 (entropy-preserving)
> CPTP measurement/reset blocks (ℰ_meas): ΔS > 0 (entropy-increasing due to information gain/loss)
> High-Entropy Sequence: Measurement-reset cycles producing ΔS_high > 0"

**Empirical reality**:
- Measurement **projects** to eigenstate → **REDUCES** entropy (wave function collapse)
- Reset → collapses to |0⟩ → **ZERO** entropy
- Our data: "High-entropy" (measurement) = 0.158 nats < "Low-entropy" (unitary) = 0.188 nats

**The only way to increase system entropy is DECOHERENCE** (interaction with environment).

**Possible interpretations**:
1. Paper meant **total** (system + environment) entropy? But we can't measure S_env in simulations.
2. Paper meant **entanglement entropy** (subsystem)? But then GHZ (high entanglement) breaks the code.
3. Paper's understanding of quantum entropy is conceptually flawed?

---

### Issue 2: Duration Matching is Practically Impossible

**Paper's requirement** (lines 359, 366):
> "Perform controlled comparisons using identical elapsed times to decouple decoherence from entropy effects"
> "Equalize T₁/T₂ exposure by matching total duration T between low-entropy and high-entropy sequences"

**Problem**: Different operations have different intrinsic durations:
- Single-qubit gate: ~50 ns
- Two-qubit gate: ~300 ns
- Measurement: ~1 μs (20x longer!)

**Solutions attempted**:
1. **Delay gates**: Break density matrix simulation (can't measure ΔS)
2. **Identity gates**: Still cause decoherence (don't achieve "fixed decoherence times")
3. **Statistical control**: Fails with perfect multicollinearity

**No working solution found**.

---

### Issue 3: Multicollinearity Prevents Proper Testing

The paper's model has **structural multicollinearity**:

```
log p_log = α + η log p_phys + β ΔS_sys + θ_duration t + ...
```

**Problem**: In practice:
- Higher noise → higher p_phys AND higher ΔS (both from decoherence)
- Longer circuits → higher t AND higher ΔS (measurements take time)
- More measurements → higher t AND different ΔS (operation type changes)

**All predictors are coupled**. Cannot vary ΔS independently while holding noise and duration fixed.

**VIF diagnostics** from our simulations:
- Noise variation: VIF(ΔS, p_phys) = 11.2
- Circuit structure: VIF(circuit_type, duration) = infinity (perfect correlation)

---

## Specific Questions for Team

### Question 1: Is the Entropy Framing Salvageable?

**Given that measurement-reset REDUCES system entropy (not increases):**

A. Should we reinterpret ΔS as **total entropy** (system + environment)?
   - Pro: Measurement increases total entropy (2nd law)
   - Con: Cannot measure S_env in simulations
   - Con: Paper specifies "system density matrix" (line 338)

B. Should we reinterpret as **entanglement entropy** (subsystem)?
   - Pro: We can measure this via partial_trace
   - Con: High entanglement (GHZ) creates valid logical states → wrong test

C. Should we **abandon the entropy framing entirely**?
   - Reframe as: "Does circuit structure affect errors beyond decoherence?"
   - Drop explicit ΔS, test operation type (measurement vs unitary)
   - Pro: Tests core idea without problematic entropy claims
   - Con: Loses connection to information-theoretic motivation

**Which interpretation (if any) makes the prediction testable?**

---

### Question 2: Duration Matching - Viable Solutions?

**Given that we cannot match durations without breaking entropy measurement:**

A. **Accept duration confound**, use statistical control?
   - Model: log(p_log) = α + β_structure + θ_duration + ε
   - Problem: Perfect multicollinearity if circuit types have fixed durations
   - Possible fix: Need >2 circuit types with overlapping durations?

B. **Redesign circuits** to naturally have same duration?
   - E.g., unitary-only with many gates vs measurement-heavy with few gates
   - Problem: Then gate count becomes confound
   - Possible fix: Match both duration AND gate count?

C. **Use real hardware** instead of simulation?
   - Fixed-duration protocols possible on real quantum computers
   - Problem: Harder to measure ΔS (requires tomography)
   - Problem: SPAM errors, drift, calibration issues

D. **Acknowledge untestability** in simulations, propose hardware-only test?
   - Honest: "This requires capabilities beyond current simulators"
   - Focus on hardware implementation roadmap

**Which approach has highest chance of success?**

---

### Question 3: Multicollinearity - Can We Break the Coupling?

**Fundamental coupling**: ΔS correlates with everything (noise, duration, operation type)

A. **Is there a circuit design** where ΔS varies independently?
   - Example: Different initial states (pure vs mixed) with same circuit?
   - Example: Different noise channels with same overall strength?

B. **Can we use instrumental variables** or causal inference methods?
   - Identify a variable that affects ΔS but not p_log directly?
   - Use two-stage regression or structural equation modeling?

C. **Should we test a weaker claim**?
   - Instead of "β > 0 controlling for all confounds"
   - Test: "β > 0 in simple regression" (confounds acknowledged)
   - Argue: "Future work will disentangle mechanisms"

**Is there a statistically sound way to test the independent effect of ΔS?**

---

### Question 4: Paper Revision Recommendations

**Given these issues, what should we recommend for Section 4 revision?**

A. **Major revision needed**:
   - Fix entropy framing (lines 352-354, 363)
   - Acknowledge duration matching challenges
   - Propose revised experimental protocol
   - Adjust expected timeline (not "testable on current NISQ hardware")

B. **Reframe as theoretical prediction** (not currently testable):
   - Keep model (line 329) as theoretical framework
   - Remove claims about near-term testability (lines 311-316, 318)
   - Add section: "Challenges and Future Directions"
   - Specify needed advances: better tomography, fixed-duration protocols

C. **Propose alternative testable predictions**:
   - Drop the ΔS framing entirely
   - Focus on testable operational differences
   - E.g., "Measurement-heavy circuits have higher errors than unitary-only at matched gate count"
   - Acknowledge this is less directly connected to information theory

**Which revision strategy best balances scientific honesty with maintaining the core LRT thesis?**

---

### Question 5: Was Our Approach Fundamentally Flawed?

**Self-check**: Did we miss something obvious?

- Are we using the wrong entropy definition?
- Should we be testing different QEC codes (surface code vs repetition)?
- Is there a standard way to test entropy effects in QEC literature we're unaware of?
- Did we misinterpret what the paper is claiming?

**Please critique our approach**. If we made fundamental errors, we need to know before recommending paper revisions.
