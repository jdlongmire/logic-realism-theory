Sprint 4 Paper Revisions Review
Multi-LLM Team Consultation
Date: October 27, 2025

==================================================
TEAM QUALITY SCORES
==================================================

Grok-3:     0.81 (GO recommendation)
Gemini-Pro: 0.77 (NO-GO recommendation)  
GPT-4:      0.605 (Generic review, unreliable)

Team Average: 0.728 (below 0.80 threshold)
Best Score:   0.83 (Grok-3 detailed assessment)

==================================================
SECTION-SPECIFIC SCORES (Grok-3)
==================================================

Section 2.3.1 (Ontological/Epistemic): 0.75
  - Rigor: 0.85, Clarity: 0.80, Completeness: 0.75, Falsifiability: 0.60

Section 3.4.1 (Non-Unitary Evolution): 0.86
  - Rigor: 0.90, Clarity: 0.85, Completeness: 0.90, Falsifiability: 0.80

Section 5.1.1 (Confound Isolation): 0.90
  - Rigor: 0.88, Clarity: 0.90, Completeness: 0.85, Falsifiability: 0.95

Section 5.1.2 (T2/T1 Derivation): 0.83
  - Rigor: 0.80, Clarity: 0.85, Completeness: 0.80, Falsifiability: 0.85

Section 9.1 (Lean Language Precision): 0.81
  - Rigor: 0.90, Clarity: 0.85, Completeness: 0.90, Falsifiability: N/A

==================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES (High Priority)
==================================================

1. Section 2.3.1:
   - Gravity analogy weak, may not resonate with physicists
   - Need better qualitative definition of "L"
   - Link to experimental predictions should be explicit

2. Section 3.4.1:
   - Physical meaning of constraint threshold K unclear
   - Mathematical details for K transitions needed
   - Transition K → K-ΔK needs elaboration

3. Section 5.1.2:
   - Phenomenological parameter η lacks sufficient justification
   - Range [0.11, 0.43] needs grounding
   - Spohn's inequality connection needs detail

==================================================
RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS (Option A)
==================================================

Quick Fixes (2 hours):
1. Replace gravity analogy with wave-particle duality example
2. Add Lean code snippet to Section 9.1
3. Add justification for confidence levels (Section 5.1.1)

Medium Effort (4 hours):
4. Add subsection defining physical meaning of K
5. Provide heuristic/empirical basis for η range
6. Expand K transition dynamics explanation

==================================================
DECISION
==================================================

Recommendation: Option A - Proceed with Minor Polishing
Rationale:
- Best reviewer (Grok-3) gives GO with 0.83 score
- Experimental sections strongest (0.83-0.90)
- Critical issues addressable in 6 hours
- Gemini concerns overlap with Grok suggestions

Sprint 4 Status: 7/10 deliverables complete (70%)
Next: Implement Option A improvements (~6 hours)
