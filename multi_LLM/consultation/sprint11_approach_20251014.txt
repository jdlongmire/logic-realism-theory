   1. Is Option B feasible (derive algebra from 3FLL)?

Feasibility: Partial

Key Challenges: The Third Fermi-Dirac Law (3FLL) is a statistical law that describes the distribution of particles in a system. It is not clear how this could be used to derive the algebraic structure of quantum mechanics, wh...
