I will provide a detailed, technically accurate solution to prove that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probability distributions is zero if and only if the distributions are equal almost everywhere. The proof will be formalized in Lean 4, a theorem prover and programming language well-suited for rigorous mathematical reasoning. I will also include explanations of the concepts involved, ensuring clarity for readers with varying levels of expertise in probability theory and formal verification.

### Problem Statement
The Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as relative entropy, is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from another. For two probability distributions \( P \) and \( Q \) defined on the same measurable space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \), with \( P \) and \( Q \) absolutely continuous with respect to a common measure \( \mu \), the KL divergence is defined as:

\[
D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = \int_{\Omega} \log\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}\right) dP
\]

where \( \frac{dP}{dQ} \) is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of \( P \) with respect to \( Q \), assuming \( P \) is absolutely continuous with respect to \( Q \) (i.e., \( P \ll Q \)). If \( P \not\ll Q \), the KL divergence is defined to be \( +\infty \).

The goal is to prove that:

\[
D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = 0 \iff P = Q \text{ almost everywhere (a.e.) with respect to } \mu
\]

### Conceptual Overview
1. **KL Divergence**: The KL divergence quantifies the difference between two distributions. It is non-negative and asymmetric, meaning \( D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) \neq D_{\text{KL}}(Q \parallel P) \) in general.
2. **Absolute Continuity**: For \( P \ll Q \), there exists a Radon-Nikodym derivative \( \frac{dP}{dQ} \), which allows us to express the KL divergence in terms of an integral.
3. **Almost Everywhere Equality**: Two measures \( P \) and \( Q \) are equal almost everywhere with respect to \( \mu \) if there exists a set \( N \in \mathcal{F} \) with \( \mu(N) = 0 \) such that for all \( \omega \notin N \), the densities (or Radon-Nikodym derivatives) of \( P \) and \( Q \) with respect to \( \mu \) are equal.
4. **Proof Strategy**:
   - **Forward Direction (\( D_{\text{KL}} = 0 \implies P = Q \text{ a.e.} \))**: Use the fact that the integrand \( \log\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}\right) \cdot \frac{dP}{dQ} \) is non-negative (since \( \log(x) \cdot x \geq 0 \) for \( x > 0 \)) and zero only when \( \frac{dP}{dQ} = 1 \), implying \( P = Q \) a.e.
   - **Reverse Direction (\( P = Q \text{ a.e.} \implies D_{\text{KL}} = 0 \))**: If \( P = Q \) a.e., then \( \frac{dP}{dQ} = 1 \) a.e., so the integrand \( \log(1) = 0 \), and the integral is zero.

### Formalization in Lean 4
Lean 4 is a dependently typed programming language and theorem prover that allows us to formalize mathematical proofs with precision. Below, I will define the necessary structures and prove the theorem. Note that Lean 4's standard library (`mathlib4`) includes support for measure theory and probability, which we will leverage.

#### Setup
We need to define a measurable space, probability measures, and the KL divergence. For simplicity, we assume a common dominating measure \( \mu \), and both \( P \) and \( Q \) have densities with respect to \( \mu \). This avoids dealing with absolute continuity directly in the code (though it is implicit in the problem statement).

```lean

-- and have densities (Radon-Nikodym derivatives) with respect to μ.

#### Main Theorem
Now, we state and prove the main result. The proof relies on the fact that the integrand is zero almost everywhere if and only if the densities are equal almost everywhere.

```lean

  -- The proof proceeds by showing that ∫ log(p/q) * p dμ = 0 implies
  -- log(p/q) * (p/q) = 0 a.e., which implies p/q = 1 a.e., i.e., p = q a.e.
  -- Conversely, if p = q a.e., then log(p/q) = 0 a.e., so the integral is 0.
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Setup**: We define a measurable space \( \Omega \), a finite measure \( \mu \), and probability measures \( P \) and \( Q \) with densities \( p \) and \( q \) respectively. We assume \( q > 0 \) to avoid division by zero in the logarithm.
2. **KL Divergence Definition**: We define the KL divergence as the integral of \( \log(p/q) \cdot p \) with respect to \( \mu \). This is equivalent to the standard definition when \( P \ll Q \).
3. **Helper Lemma**: The lemma `log_mul_ge_zero` establishes that \( \log(x) \cdot x \geq 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), and equals zero if and only if \( x = 1 \). This is key to showing that the integrand being zero implies \( p/q = 1 \).
4. **Main Theorem**: The theorem states the equivalence between \( D_{\text{KL}} = 0 \) and \( p = q \) almost everywhere. The proof sketch uses the non-negativity of the integrand and properties of integrals over almost everywhere zero functions.

### Challenges and Notes
- **Absolute Continuity**: The code assumes \( P \ll \mu \) and \( Q \ll \mu \), but in the general case, we need \( P \ll Q \). Extending the proof to handle cases where \( P \not\ll Q \) (where KL divergence is infinite) is straightforward but omitted for brevity.
- **Integrability**: We implicitly assume the integral defining KL divergence exists. In practice, we need to ensure \( \log(p/q) \cdot p \) is integrable, which requires additional conditions or handling of infinities.
- **Lean 4 Limitations**: The `sorry` placeholders indicate parts of the proof that require more detailed formalization, such as convexity arguments or integrability conditions. These can be filled in using `mathlib4`'s extensive library on measure theory.

### Conclusion
This solution provides a formal framework in Lean 4 to prove that the KL divergence between two probability distributions is zero if and only if the distributions are equal almost everywhere. The proof leverages properties of logarithms, integrals, and measure theory, formalized in a rigorous type-theoretic setting. For a complete implementation, one would need to address the `sorry` placeholders with detailed subproofs, but the structure and key ideas are fully outlined.
