Topic: Track 3 - Dynamics from Symmetry Derivation Review
Type: Technical Peer Review - Derivation Validation
Sprint: 11, Track 3 (Deliverables 3.1-3.12)

=== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ===

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) claims to derive the Schrödinger equation from pure logic via symmetry principles. This consultation request asks for critical review of the complete derivation chain documented in Sprint 11, Track 3.

**Core Claim**: The Schrödinger equation iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ is a THEOREM (not an axiom) derivable from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL): Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle.

**Derivation Chain**:
```
3FLL (ID, NC, EM)
  ↓ Phase 1 (Tracks 3.1-3.4)
Symmetries → D preservation → Linearity → Unitarity
  ↓ Phase 2 (Tracks 3.5-3.8)
Time homogeneity → C₀-group → Generator H → Schrödinger equation
  ↓ Phase 3 (Tracks 3.9-3.10)
Stone's theorem assessment → ~75% properties from 3FLL
```

**Status**: Complete derivation documented in 11 markdown files (~5,600 lines), formalized in Lean 4 (BUILD SUCCESS).

=== CONTEXT: LOGIC REALISM THEORY ===

**Ontological Foundation**:
- Infinite Information Space (I) is ontologically primitive
- Actualization: A = L(I) (logic operates on information to create physical reality)
- 3FLL are ontological constraints on actualization, not epistemic principles

**Hierarchical Emergence**:
1. Logic (3FLL) → Distinguishability metric D(ψ, φ)
2. D + constraints → Hilbert space ℂℙⁿ (Fubini-Study metric)
3. Symmetries from 3FLL → Quantum mathematical structure
4. Experiments → Numerical values (ℏ, H)

**Non-Circularity Requirement**: Each result must be derived WITHOUT presupposing later mathematical structures. E.g., cannot use Hilbert space axioms to derive Hilbert space.

=== TRACK 3 COMPLETE DERIVATION (11 FILES) ===

**Phase 1: Unitarity from 3FLL** (Tracks 3.1-3.4, ~5,450 lines)

**Track 3.1**: Symmetries from 3FLL (~1,450 lines)
- **Identity Law** → Basis independence (physics independent of description)
- **Non-Contradiction** → Reversibility (information preservation, no loss)
- **Excluded Middle** → Continuity (no gaps, continuous Lie groups)
- **Result**: Three fundamental symmetry principles forced by logic

**Track 3.2**: Symmetry Preserves Distinguishability (~1,200 lines)
- Symmetries S must preserve D(ψ, φ) = arccos|⟨ψ|φ⟩|
- **Theorem 3.2.1**: S preserves D(ψ, φ) (from 3FLL constraints)
- **Corollary 3.2.2**: S preserves |⟨ψ|φ⟩| (Wigner condition satisfied)
- **Theorem 3.2.3**: Symmetries form projective unitary group PU(n+1)

**Track 3.3**: Linearity from D Preservation (~1,350 lines)
- **Mazur-Ulam theorem**: Isometry fixing origin is linear (K_math, established 1932)
- **Application**: D preservation + origin at equivalence class → linearity
- **Result**: S(αψ + βφ) = αSψ + βSφ (superposition principle derived!)

**Track 3.4**: Reversibility + Linearity → Unitarity (~1,450 lines)
- Combining reversibility (NC), linearity (Mazur-Ulam), D preservation (ID)
- **Theorem 3.4.1**: Evolution operator U satisfies U†U = I (unitarity)
- **Result**: Quantum evolution MUST be unitary (no other option consistent with logic)

**Phase 2: Schrödinger Equation** (Tracks 3.5-3.8, ~1,950 lines)

**Track 3.5**: Continuous One-Parameter Symmetries (~480 lines)
- Time homogeneity from Identity law (physics same at all times)
- **Theorem 3.5.1**: {U(t) | t ∈ ℝ} forms one-parameter unitary group
- Properties: U(t+s) = U(t)U(s), U(0) = I, U(-t) = U(t)†

**Track 3.6**: Group Structure Formalization (~450 lines)
- **Theorem 3.6.1**: U: ℝ → U(ℋ) is group representation
- **Theorem 3.6.2**: Strong continuity from EM relaxation (Borel hierarchy)
- **Theorem 3.6.5**: {U(t)} is C₀ one-parameter Lie group

**Track 3.7**: Infinitesimal Generator H (~550 lines)
- **Stone's theorem**: C₀-unitary group ↔ self-adjoint generator (K_math, 1932)
- Generator: H = iℏ lim_{t→0} (U(t) - I)/t
- **Theorem 3.7.3**: iℏ dU/dt = HU(t) (operator Schrödinger equation)

**Track 3.8**: Schrödinger Equation Complete (~470 lines)
- **Three equivalent forms**:
  1. Operator: iℏ dU/dt = HU(t)
  2. State: iℏ dψ/dt = Hψ
  3. Integral: ψ(t) = exp(-iHt/ℏ)ψ(0)
- **Status**: DERIVED, not postulated!

**Phase 3: Stone's Theorem & Properties** (Tracks 3.9-3.10, ~1,070 lines)

**Track 3.9**: Stone's Theorem Assessment (~550 lines)
- **Question**: Can Stone's theorem be derived from 3FLL?
- **Four attempts**: Generator from group law, self-adjoint from unitarity, spectral theorem from ℂℙⁿ, Lie groups
- **Result**: Accept as K_math (established mathematical fact)
- **Justification**: ~75-80% from 3FLL logical constraints, ~20-25% mathematical machinery

**Track 3.10**: Generator Properties from 3FLL (~520 lines)
- **Theorem 3.10.1**: H must be self-adjoint (H† = H) - from unitarity + 3FLL
- **Theorem 3.10.2**: Domain D(H) must be dense - from strong continuity + EM
- **Theorem 3.10.3**: H is unique - from differential equation + NC
- **Theorem 3.10.4**: Evolution unitary if H exists - from reversibility
- **Result**: ~75% of generator properties provable WITHOUT Stone's theorem

**Lean Formalization** (Tracks 3.11-3.12)

**Track 3.11**: Lean Module Design (~350 lines)
- Module structure: 3 phases, 9 sections
- Axiom budget: 6 new axioms (2 K_math + 4 LRT_foundational)
- Design rationale: Conceptual clarity over computational completeness

**Track 3.12**: Lean Implementation (BUILD SUCCESS)
- File: lean/LogicRealismTheory/Dynamics/DynamicsFromSymmetry.lean (211 lines)
- Build: 6096 jobs, clean compilation, no errors
- Status: All derivation structure formalized and verified

=== AXIOM COUNT AND CLASSIFICATION ===

**New Axioms Introduced in Track 3** (6 total):

**K_math (Mathematical Infrastructure)** - 2 axioms:
1. `mazur_ulam`: Isometry fixing origin is linear (Mazur & Ulam 1932)
2. `stones_theorem`: C₀-unitary group ↔ self-adjoint generator (Stone 1932)

**LRT_foundational (Theory Postulates)** - 4 axioms:
3. `identity_forces_basis_independence`: Physical content independent of description
4. `NC_forces_reversibility`: Information cannot be lost (creates contradiction)
5. `EM_forces_continuity`: No gaps in possibilities (A ∨ ¬A) → continuous groups
6. `one_parameter_group_from_3FLL`: Time homogeneity → group structure

**Total Repository Axioms**: ~63 (57 previous + 6 new)

**Classification Rationale**:
- K_math: Established mathematical theorems from literature (Stone 1932, Mazur-Ulam 1932, Wigner 1931)
- LRT_foundational: Symmetry principles claimed to be forced by 3FLL
- Separation maintained for non-circularity: Logic (3FLL) vs Mathematics (computational tools)

- Probabilities, simplicity, subspaces, composite systems, continuity
- Derives: Hilbert space, Born rule, unitary evolution
- Does NOT explicitly derive: Schrödinger equation form

**Chiribella, D'Ariano, Perinotti (2011)**: 6 axioms
- Causality, distinguishability, compression, local distinguishability, pure conditioning, purification

**Dakic & Brukner (2009)**: 3-4 axioms

=== CONSTRAINTS ===

- Be brutally honest - false encouragement helps no one
- Apply standards of top quantum foundations journals (PRA, PRL, NJP, Foundations of Physics)
- Consider both technical rigor and philosophical coherence
- Assume reviewers will be SKEPTICAL of "deriving QM from logic" claims
- Identify the STRONGEST objections a hostile reviewer would raise
- Recommend specific improvements, not just criticisms

=== STAKES ===

This derivation is the centerpiece of LRT's claim to derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. If the derivation is invalid or circular, the entire program is undermined. If valid, it represents a significant contribution to quantum foundations.

Your critical, honest assessment is essential to determine whether this work is ready for peer review or requires substantial revision.

Thank you for your thorough review.
