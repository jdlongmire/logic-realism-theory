# Lean 4 Proof Strategy Consultation

Need expert guidance on completing this Lean 4 theorem proof.

## Context
Sprint 11 K-threshold resolution - proving K_superposition = 1.0 is mathematically derived (NOT arbitrary).

## Theorem
```lean
theorem K_entropy_superposition :
    K_entropy ket_plus = 1 := by
  unfold K_entropy ket_plus prob_0 prob_1
  norm_num [normSq_ofReal, Real.log_div, Real.log_one]
  sorry
```

## Definitions
```lean
-- K_entropy: Shannon entropy normalized by log(2)
noncomputable def K_entropy (ψ : QubitState) : ℝ :=
  let p0 := prob_0 ψ
  let p1 := prob_1 ψ
  if p0 = 0 ∨ p1 = 0 then
    0
  else
    -(p0 * Real.log p0 + p1 * Real.log p1) / Real.log 2

-- ket_plus: Equal superposition  = (zero + one)/sqrt2
noncomputable def ket_plus : QubitState :=
  ⟨1/sqrt 2, 1/sqrt 2, by simp [normSq_ofReal]; norm_num⟩

-- prob_0, prob_1: Born rule probabilities
def prob_0 (ψ : QubitState) : ℝ := normSq ψ.alpha
def prob_1 (ψ : QubitState) : ℝ := normSq ψ.beta
```

## Goal After Unfold
After unfolding, need to prove that the Shannon entropy H(1/2, 1/2) divided by log(2) equals 1.

The numerical computation is: -(1/2 * log(1/2) + 1/2 * log(1/2)) / log 2 = 1

Where normSq (1/sqrt 2) = 1/2.

## Challenges
1. **If-then-else handling**: The definition has if p0 = 0 or p1 = 0 guard
2. **Complex normSq**: Need normSq (1/sqrt 2 as complex) = (1/2 as real)
3. **Logarithm simplification**: log(1/2) = -log(2)
4. **simp changes goal unpredictably**: Previous attempts with simp changed goal state in unexpected ways

## Previous Attempts
- **calc chain with simp**: Goal state changed unpredictably after simp
- **norm_num alone**: Didn't fully solve, still needs sorry
- **Manual rewrites**: Hit type errors with if-then-else

## Questions
1. **Best tactic approach**: norm_num? decide? rfl? calc chain without simp?
2. **Auxiliary lemmas**: Should I prove normSq (1/sqrt 2) = 1/2 separately first?
3. **If-then-else**: How to handle the guard without simp changing the goal?
4. **Alternative strategy**: Is there a simpler computational proof path?

## Available Lemmas
- Real.log_div (hx : x not-equal 0) (hy : y not-equal 0) : log (x / y) = log x - log y
- Real.log_inv (x : ℝ) : log x-inverse = -log x
- Real.log_one : log 1 = 0
- normSq_ofReal, sq_sqrt, normSq_div

## Expected Output

## Sprint Importance
This is the CRITICAL Sprint 11 theorem - it directly justifies that K_superposition = 1.0 used throughout the paper is NOT an arbitrary choice but follows mathematically from maximal entropy for equal superposition states.
