   As Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, I approach this audit with a critical eye, focusing on the hard data, the claims made, and the underlying rigor of the "Physical Logic Framework" as presented. My goal is to dissect the structure, identify overclaims, and assess whether this work constitutes real physics ...
