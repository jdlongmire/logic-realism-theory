## Summary of Tahko's Paper

Tahko surveys "logical realism" as a metaphysical view about the status of logic. His key contributions:

### 1. Definition of Logical Realism

Two core theses (from LaPointe/Resnik):

**(LF)** There are *logical facts* (or 'logical structure')—there is a fact of the matter about logical claims.

**(IND)** Logical facts are *independent* of our cognitive and linguistic make-up. They are objective in the sense of being mind- and language-independent.

### 2. Two Versions of Logical Realism

Tahko distinguishes (following McSweeney):

| Version | Claim | Logical Constants |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Realism about logical constants** | Logical constants refer to individual entities | Have "worldly presence" |
| **Realism about logical structure** | There is D-fundamental logical structure | No distinct worldly presence |

### 3. E-Project vs D-Project (Fine's Distinction)

- **E-project**: What can be *said* (expressed) in fundamental terms
- **D-project**: What can be *described* in fundamental terms

Logical constants are plausibly E-fundamental (we need them to express things). The question is whether they are D-fundamental (part of the world's structure being described).

### 4. The Overgeneration Problem

If realism about logical structure is true: What counts as *logical* structure, apart from just structure? Does logical realism collapse into standard metaphysical realism?

### 5. The Case of Negation

Tahko suggests **primitive incompatibility** as a genuine worldly feature that grounds negation—not a logical constant as entity, but a structural feature.

### 6. Connection to Dialetheism

- **Semantic dialetheism**: Contradictions in language (acceptable)
- **Metaphysical dialetheism**: Contradictions in reality (controversial—Priest)

## Relevance to Logic Realism Theory (LRT)

### LRT Satisfies (LF) and (IND)

LRT explicitly commits to both theses:
- **(LF)**: The 3FLL are facts about what structures are permissible
- **(IND)**: These facts are mind- and language-independent—they are ontological constraints, not cognitive conventions

### LRT as "Realism About Logical Structure"

LRT aligns more closely with realism about logical structure than realism about logical constants:

| Tahko's Framework | LRT Position |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Logical constants have worldly presence? | No—3FLL constrain structure, not as entities |
| Logical structure is D-fundamental? | Yes—distinguishability itself requires 3FLL |
| E-fundamental vs D-fundamental? | 3FLL are D-fundamental (structure), expressed via E-fundamental constants |

### LRT Addresses the Overgeneration Problem

Tahko asks: "What counts as logical structure, apart from just structure?"

**LRT's answer**: Logical structure is *constitutive of physical distinguishability*. Not all structure is logical structure—specifically, logical structure is what makes information coherent.

The derivation chain shows this:
```
3FLL → Distinguishability metric D(s₁,s₂) → Inner product → QM
```

The 3FLL aren't arbitrary constraints—they're what makes *any* structure distinguishable at all. This avoids collapse into generic metaphysical realism because:

1. **Specificity**: The 3FLL pick out exactly those structures capable of bearing information
2. **Derivational work**: The 3FLL do real work in deriving QM structure (not just labeling)
3. **Falsifiability**: Violation of 3FLL at actuality would falsify LRT (not just "metaphysics")

### LRT on Negation and Incompatibility

Tahko suggests primitive incompatibility as the worldly basis of negation. LRT agrees:

> "The same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject in the same respect." (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1005b19–20)

LRT reads this as **Non-Contradiction (LNC)** being a constraint on what can be *actual*. The incompatibility is real—it's why detectors never read spin-up AND spin-down.

### LRT Rejects Metaphysical Dialetheism

Tahko notes Priest's metaphysical dialetheism: "there are aspects of the world for which any accurate description will contain a true contradiction."

**LRT explicitly rejects this**:
- Stage 1 (Representable): Can include paraconsistent structures
- Stage 2 (Permissible): LRT-compliant only
- Stage 3 (Actual): No contradictions—forbidden by LNC

The IIS-LRT three-stage framework provides a precise location for where contradictions are excluded (Stage 2→3 transition).

### LRT Goes Beyond Tahko's Survey

Tahko surveys the metaphysical landscape but doesn't connect logical realism to physics. LRT does:

| Tahko | LRT |
|-------|-----|
| Logical realism as metaphysical position | Logical realism as *physical* postulate |
| Epistemic access via cognitive mechanisms (Maddy) | Epistemic access via QM reconstruction theorems |
| "Foundation for logic" as philosophical project | Foundation for logic yields *complex QM uniquely* |
| Overgeneration problem acknowledged | Solved by derivational specificity |

## Key Quotes for LRT Positioning

### On Mind-Independence

> "Logical facts are independent of our cognitive and linguistic make-up and practices. They are objective in the sense that they are mind- and language-independent." (p. 4776)

**LRT**: Agrees completely. The 3FLL hold whether or not minds exist to recognize them.

### On Worldly Grounding

> "Logic is true of the world because of its underlying structural features." (Maddy, quoted p. 4780)

**LRT**: Yes—and we can derive *which* structural features from the 3FLL.

### On the E/D Distinction

> "The E-project is concerned with saying what can be said in the most fundamental terms, while the D-project is concerned with describing what can be described in the most fundamental terms." (Fine, quoted p. 4785)

**LRT**: The 3FLL are D-fundamental (part of what's being described), expressed via E-fundamental logical vocabulary.

### On Primitive Incompatibility

> "I suggest that negation be explained in terms of the primitive notion of incompatibility." (Price, quoted p. 4787)

**LRT**: Agrees. LNC captures a real feature of reality—certain states are genuinely incompatible.

### On Collapse to Metaphysical Realism

> "Does logical realism collapse into standard metaphysical realism?" (p. 4788)

**LRT**: No—because the 3FLL do specific derivational work that generic "structure" doesn't. The derivation of QM uniquely from 3FLL demonstrates this.

## Implications for LRT Development

### 1. Cite Tahko When Positioning LRT

LRT should explicitly engage with this literature. Tahko provides the framework; LRT provides the physics.

### 2. Clarify LRT's Version of Logical Realism

LRT is "realism about logical structure" with these additions:
- The structure is *physically* instantiated (not Platonic)
- The structure is *derivationally productive* (yields QM)
- The structure is *falsifiable* (macroscopic P∧¬P would refute)

### 3. Address Overgeneration Explicitly

Future LRT papers should address Tahko's overgeneration problem head-on:
- Why 3FLL specifically, not arbitrary structure?
- Answer: 3FLL are constitutive of distinguishability; without them, no information

### 4. Engage with Dialetheism Literature

LRT's explicit rejection of metaphysical dialetheism should engage with Priest's arguments. The three-stage framework provides the response: contradictions are representable (Stage 1) but not actualizable (Stage 3).

## Potential Response/Engagement

Tahko is at University of Bristol. A response paper could:

1. Position LRT within Tahko's framework
2. Show how LRT addresses the overgeneration problem
3. Demonstrate the physics payoff (QM reconstruction)
4. Argue that logical realism becomes empirically testable when connected to QM

Title suggestion: "From Logical Realism to Quantum Mechanics: Logic Realism Theory as Applied Metaphysics of Logic"
