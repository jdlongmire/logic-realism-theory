## Priority Contacts

### 1. Tuomas Tahko
**Position**: Professor of Metaphysics of Science, University of Bristol
**Email**: tuomas.tahko@bristol.ac.uk
**Website**: [ttahko.net](https://www.ttahko.net/)
**Relevance**: Author of the survey paper; works at metaphysics-of-science intersection
**Key Work**: "A Survey of Logical Realism" (2021)
**LRT Connection**: His framework (LF + IND, overgeneration problem) maps directly onto LRT

---

### 2. Michaela McSweeney
**Position**: Associate Professor of Philosophy, Boston University
**Email**: m3@bu.edu
**Website**: [michaela-mcsweeney.com](https://www.michaela-mcsweeney.com)
**Profile**: [BU Philosophy](https://www.bu.edu/philo/profile/michaela-mcsweeney/)
**Relevance**: Leading contemporary work on logical realism
**Key Work**: "Following Logical Realism Where It Leads" (2019); "Logical Realism and the Metaphysics of Logic" (2019)
**LRT Connection**: Her "metaphysical logical realism" (One True Logic made true by mind-independent world) aligns closely with LRT's position. She distinguishes ontological vs ideological realism—LRT offers a physics-grounded answer.

### 3. Gila Sher
**Position**: Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, UC San Diego
**Email**: gsher@ucsd.edu
**Website**: [UCSD Faculty Page](https://philosophy.ucsd.edu/people/faculty-sites/gsher/index.html)
**Relevance**: Logic grounded "both in the mind and in the world"; veridicality of logic
**Key Work**: *Epistemic Friction* (2016); "Is Logic in the Mind or in the World?" (2011)
**LRT Connection**: Her dual grounding (mind + world) relates to LRT's claim that 3FLL constrain both cognitive and physical structures. Her 2024 paper "Logical Realism: A Tale of Two Theories" directly relevant.
**Note**: Editor-in-chief of *Synthese* (2012-2017); editor of *Journal of Philosophy* since 2017

### 4. Ted Sider
**Position**: Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Rutgers University
**Email**: sider@rutgers.edu
**Website**: [tedsider.org](https://tedsider.org/)
**Profile**: [Rutgers Philosophy](https://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/regular-faculty/regular-faculty-profile/182-regular-faculty-full-time/780-sider-ted)
**Relevance**: Fundamentality, joint-carving, "Writing the Book of the World"
**Key Work**: *Writing the Book of the World* (2011)
**LRT Connection**: His notion of "joint-carving" and fundamental structure relates to whether 3FLL are D-fundamental. LRT claims they are—and derives physics from them.

---

### 5. Francesco Berto
**Position**: Professor of Philosophy, University of St Andrews
**Website**: [St Andrews Profile](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/staff/franz-berto/)
**Relevance**: Negation as incompatibility; "A Modality Called 'Negation'"
**Key Work**: "A Modality Called 'Negation'" (2015); "Negation on the Australian Plan" (2019)
**LRT Connection**: His thesis that incompatibility "carves nature at its joints" aligns with LRT's treatment of Non-Contradiction. The three-stage framework locates where incompatibility becomes operative.
**Note**: Editor-in-chief of *The Philosophical Quarterly*

---

### 6. Sandra LaPointe
**Position**: Professor of Philosophy, McMaster University
**Email**: lapointe@mcmaster.ca
**Website**: [McMaster Page](https://hmcwordpress.humanities.mcmaster.ca/lapointe/)
**Relevance**: Defined the (LF) + (IND) framework for logical realism; Bolzano scholar
**Key Work**: "Bolzano's Logical Realism" (2014); edited *The Metaphysics of Logic* (Cambridge, 2014)
**LRT Connection**: Her formalization of logical realism theses is the framework LRT explicitly satisfies.

## Secondary Contacts

### 7. Penelope Maddy
**Position**: Distinguished Professor Emerita, UC Irvine
**Website**: [UCI Faculty Page](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/pjmaddy/)
**Relevance**: Naturalism about logic; "logic describes the underlying structure of the world"
**Key Work**: *Second Philosophy* (2007)
**LRT Connection**: Her naturalistic project—finding causal links between rudimentary logic and logical structure—relates to LRT's claim that 3FLL are physically instantiated.
**Note**: Retired 2020; may be less active but highly influential

---

### 8. Graham Priest
**Position**: Distinguished Professor, CUNY Graduate Center (emeritus)
**Relevance**: Dialetheism—would be a critic/opponent
**Key Work**: *In Contradiction* (2006)
**LRT Connection**: LRT explicitly rejects metaphysical dialetheism. Engaging with Priest would sharpen the three-stage framework's handling of contradictions.

---

### 9. Stewart Shapiro
**Position**: O'Donnell Professor of Philosophy, Ohio State University
**Relevance**: Logical pluralism; "folk-relativism" about logic
**Key Work**: "Pluralism, Relativism, and Objectivity" (2014)
**LRT Connection**: LRT is monist about logic (3FLL uniquely correct at actuality). Engaging pluralist critiques would strengthen the position.

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Tier 1: Direct Outreach
- **Tahko**: Already drafted email
- **McSweeney**: Her 2019 work directly addresses LRT's concerns; high relevance
- **Sher**: Her dual-grounding view and editorial positions make her strategic

### Tier 2: Conference/Paper Engagement
- **Berto**: Submit to *Philosophical Quarterly* (he's editor-in-chief)
- **LaPointe**: Cite her framework explicitly; potential for edited volume contribution
- **Sider**: His fundamentality framework is standard reference; engage in paper

### Tier 3: Critical Engagement
- **Priest**: Invite critique; would sharpen IIS-LRT on contradictions
- **Shapiro**: Pluralism challenge; LRT must address why 3FLL are privileged
