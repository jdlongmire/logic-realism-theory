# When Logical Realism Gets Expensive: McSweeney on the Cost of Taking Logic Seriously

## A philosopher argues that if logic reflects reality, we can't assume logically equivalent theories are the same. LRT agrees - and offers a way forward.

Michaela McSweeney's 2021 paper makes a provocative argument: if you take logical realism seriously, you have to pay a price. Specifically, you can't keep assuming that logically equivalent theories are theoretically equivalent.

**Paper**: McSweeney, M.M. (2021). "The Cost of Closure: Logical Realism, Anti-Exceptionalism, and Theoretical Equivalence." *Synthese* 199, 12795-12817. [DOI: 10.1007/s11229-021-03354-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03354-7)

This matters for LRT because McSweeney is working out the consequences of the same metaphysical position LRT adopts - and finding that it has teeth.

## The Setup

Philosophers of science typically assume two things:

**Closure**: Theories are closed under logical consequence. If T is your theory and T logically implies P, then P is part of your theory.

**Equivalence**: Logically equivalent theories are theoretically equivalent. If T₁ and T₂ have the same logical consequences, they're the same theory (in some important sense).

These seem innocuous. They're how we usually think about theories.

McSweeney argues that two positions - both of which have serious defenders - undermine these assumptions.

---

## Anti-Exceptionalism About Logic

The first position is **anti-exceptionalism**: logic isn't special. It's not a priori, it's revisable, and it's continuous with other forms of inquiry.

This view has gained ground in recent philosophy. If logic is revisable like other theories, then we might revise it. And if we revise our logic, our judgments about what's "logically equivalent" change.

**The epistemic problem**: We can't be certain our current logic is correct. So we can't be certain that theories we judge equivalent actually are equivalent.

---

## Logical Realism

The second position is **logical realism**: differences in logic reflect genuine metaphysical differences in the world.

This is the view LRT endorses. Logic isn't just a formal game - it tracks real structure.

McSweeney draws out a consequence: if logical realism is true, then the choice of logic isn't arbitrary. It's a claim about reality. And different logics describe *different worlds*.

**The metaphysical problem**: If logical realism is true, "logically equivalent" under one logic might not be equivalent under the true logic. Equivalence judgments presuppose we've got the right logic - but logical realism says that's a substantive metaphysical question, not a given.

---

## The Cost

McSweeney's title captures it: closure and equivalence have a **cost** if you're a logical realist.

You can't just assume theories closed under "logical consequence" if you're uncertain which logic is correct. You can't assume logical equivalence preserves theoretical equivalence if logic itself is a theory about reality.

This isn't a refutation of logical realism. McSweeney isn't saying we should abandon it. She's saying we should be clear about what it costs.

## Where LRT Enters

LRT accepts the cost - and argues we can afford it.

**On anti-exceptionalism**: LRT agrees logic isn't a priori in the traditional sense. But it's not revisable in the way empirical theories are. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) are constitutive of distinguishability itself. Revise them, and you lose the ability to have theories at all.

**On logical realism**: LRT doesn't just claim there's "some" logical structure in the world. It claims the 3FLL are that structure, and derives quantum mechanics from them. This provides a constraint on which logic is the "true" logic - the one that yields physics.

**On equivalence**: LRT offers a criterion. Theories are genuinely equivalent only if they're equivalent under the logic that generates correct physics. The derivation chain (3FLL → QM) provides a touchstone.

## McSweeney's "One True Logic"

In her earlier work, McSweeney defends what she calls **metaphysical logical realism**: the view that there's One True Logic, it's made true by the mind-independent world, and it captures reality's structure better than alternatives.

LRT agrees with all three claims. But LRT adds something: an argument for *which* logic is the One True Logic.

The 3FLL aren't just candidates among many. They're the unique logical structure that:
1. Makes information coherent
2. Generates distinguishability
3. Yields quantum mechanics when applied to state spaces

That's not proof by assertion. It's proof by derivation.

---

## The Methodological Lesson

McSweeney draws a lesson for methodology: if you're a logical realist, you can't do metaphysics or philosophy of science as if logic were settled. Logic is itself part of what you're theorizing about.

LRT takes this seriously. The theory doesn't presuppose a logic and then do physics. It treats the choice of logic as a physical question with physical consequences.

This is what it means to elevate logic from background assumption to falsifiable postulate. The cost McSweeney identifies is real - but it's also the price of taking logic seriously as part of reality.

## For Further Reading

McSweeney's work is some of the best contemporary philosophy on logical realism. Her papers provide the conceptual framework within which LRT operates:

- ["Following Logical Realism Where It Leads"](https://philpapers.org/rec/MCSFLR) (2019) - The epistemic challenges
- ["Logical Realism and the Metaphysics of Logic"](https://philpapers.org/rec/MCSLRA) (2019) - The metaphysical framework
- ["The Cost of Closure"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03354-7) (2021) - The price of commitment

Her ongoing work on naturalism and logical methodology continues to develop these themes. A talk she gave in 2024 - "Logic and Metaphysics: One Big Mess" - suggests the territory remains contested.

## The Connection

McSweeney asks: what follows if logical realism is true?

LRT asks: what follows if logical realism is *physically* true?

The answer, it turns out, is quantum mechanics.
