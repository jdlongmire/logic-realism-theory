# Welcome to Logic Realism Theory

## What if the laws of logic aren't just rules for thinking, but laws of physics?

---

This is the first post of a Substack dedicated to exploring a radical but surprisingly productive idea: **the three fundamental laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - are ontological constraints on physical reality itself.**

I'll be using this space for two purposes:

1. **Presenting Logic Realism Theory (LRT)** - a framework I've been developing that derives quantum mechanics from logical first principles
2. **Commentary on breaking research** - new papers, experimental results, and theoretical developments that support (or challenge) this perspective

Everything here is open. The complete theory, derivations, and development history are available in the [Logic Realism Theory repository](https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory/tree/master/theory).

## The Core Idea in 60 Seconds

Every measurement in the history of physics has yielded a single definite outcome. Detectors never record contradictory states. This isn't just convenient - it's universal and exceptionless.

Standard quantum mechanics assumes this without explanation. LRT asks: *why*?

**The answer**: The laws of logic aren't tools we use to describe physics. They're constitutive constraints that determine what physical states are possible in the first place.

From this foundation, quantum mechanics emerges not as a postulate but as a theorem:

```
3FLL → Distinguishability Metric → Inner Product → Hilbert Space → Complex QM
```

The derivation chain shows that complex quantum mechanics is the *unique* probabilistic theory satisfying LRT axioms.

## What Makes This Different

Most interpretations of quantum mechanics take the formalism as given and argue about what it means. Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Bohmian mechanics - they all start with Hilbert spaces and wavefunctions.

LRT goes deeper. Instead of interpreting quantum mechanics, it *derives* it.

And the derivation reveals something interesting: the same logical laws that govern valid inference also determine the structure of physical state spaces. Logic and physics aren't separate magisteria. They're unified at the foundation.

## The Three-Stage Framework

The most recent development combines LRT with an information-theoretic ontology I call IIS-LRT. It proposes three levels of existence:

**Stage 1: Representable** - All formally specifiable structures (including contradictions)

**Stage 2: Permissible** - LRT-filtered subset where physics lives

**Stage 3: Actual** - Single outcome selected per measurement

This framework has an interesting consequence for the Many-Worlds interpretation. MWI and IIS-LRT share Stages 1-2, but diverge at Stage 3:

- **MWI**: All permissible outcomes actualize (in different branches)
- **IIS-LRT**: One outcome actualizes; others remain merely permissible

Same explanatory work. Vastly different ontologies. Parsimony suggests IIS-LRT.

## Current Status: Honest Assessment

I'm a researcher, not a salesman. Here's where things actually stand:

**What's Established:**
- Technical reconstruction from 3FLL to complex QM (peer review: A+ grade)
- Variational framework 98% derived from first principles (~3,700 lines)
- Scale Law paper validated across 7 experimental platforms
- Clear metaphysical commitments (not hidden behind formalism)

**What's Open:**
- Born rule derivation from IIS-LRT principles (central open problem)
- Distinctive empirical prediction in macroscopic regime
- External peer engagement

## An Invitation

If you're interested in quantum foundations, philosophy of physics, or the relationship between logic and physical law, this Substack is for you.

I'm not claiming LRT is the final answer. I'm claiming it's a productive research program - generating novel connections, making testable claims, and asking questions that other frameworks presuppose away.

The full repository is open for scrutiny: [github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory](https://github.com/jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory)

Comments, critiques, and collaboration welcome.
