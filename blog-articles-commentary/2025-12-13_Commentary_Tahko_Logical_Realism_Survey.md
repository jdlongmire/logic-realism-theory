# What Is "Logical Realism"? And Why Does It Matter for Physics?

## A philosopher's survey of logical realism provides the framework for understanding what Logic Realism Theory claims - and why it's different.

A 2021 paper by Tuomas Tahko surveys a position in philosophy called "logical realism." Reading it clarified something important: LRT isn't inventing a new metaphysical position. It's taking an established philosophical framework and showing it has consequences for physics.

**Paper**: Tahko, T.E. (2021). "A survey of logical realism." *Synthese* 198, 4775-4790. [DOI: 10.1007/s11229-019-02369-5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-019-02369-5)

## What Is Logical Realism?

Tahko identifies two core theses:

**(LF) There are logical facts.** There's a fact of the matter about logical claims - they're not just conventions or useful fictions.

**(IND) Logical facts are mind-independent.** They don't depend on our cognitive or linguistic practices. They're objective.

If both theses are true, then logic describes something real about the world, not just something about how we think or speak.

## Two Versions

Tahko distinguishes two flavors of logical realism:

**Realism about logical constants** - Logical terms like "and," "or," "not" refer to actual entities in the world. They have what philosophers call "worldly presence."

**Realism about logical structure** - There's genuine logical structure in reality, but not as separate entities. It's more like the scaffolding that makes structure possible.

This distinction matters. LRT aligns with the second version. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) aren't entities floating around in the universe. They're constraints on what structures can exist.

## The Overgeneration Problem

Tahko raises a sharp question: If logical realism is true, what makes logical structure *logical*, as opposed to just structure in general? Does logical realism collapse into plain metaphysical realism - the view that there's a mind-independent world?

This is a real problem. If "logical structure" just means "structure," then logical realism says nothing distinctive.

**LRT's answer**: Logical structure is what makes information coherent. The 3FLL aren't arbitrary constraints - they're what makes *any* structure distinguishable at all.

The derivation shows this concretely:

3FLL → Distinguishability metric → Inner product → Hilbert space → Complex QM

The 3FLL do specific work. They yield quantum mechanics uniquely. That's not something generic "structure" does.

## Negation and Incompatibility

One of Tahko's most interesting suggestions: negation should be understood through **primitive incompatibility**. Not as a logical operation we perform, but as a real feature of the world - some states genuinely exclude others.

LRT agrees. When we say a detector can't read spin-up AND spin-down simultaneously, that's not a limitation of our language. It's a fact about reality. The states are genuinely incompatible.

This is Non-Contradiction as an ontological constraint, not just a rule of inference.

## Where Contradictions Live

Tahko discusses dialetheism - the view that some contradictions are true. He distinguishes:

**Semantic dialetheism** - Contradictions in language (the Liar paradox). Relatively uncontroversial.

**Metaphysical dialetheism** - Contradictions in reality itself. Much more controversial. Graham Priest defends this.

LRT has a precise answer: the three-stage framework.

**Stage 1 (Representable)**: Paraconsistent structures can be formally specified. We can write down P∧¬P.

**Stage 2 (Permissible)**: Only LRT-compliant structures can be physically instantiated.

**Stage 3 (Actual)**: No contradictions. Ever.

Contradictions are thinkable. They're not actualizable. The framework locates exactly where the exclusion happens.

## What LRT Adds

Tahko surveys the metaphysical landscape but doesn't connect logical realism to physics. That's where LRT enters.

**Tahko**: Logical realism is a metaphysical position.
**LRT**: Logical realism is a physical postulate with testable consequences.

**Tahko**: We access logical facts through cognitive mechanisms.
**LRT**: We access logical facts through QM reconstruction theorems.

**Tahko**: The "foundation for logic" is a philosophical project.
**LRT**: The foundation for logic yields complex QM as the unique solution.

**Tahko**: The overgeneration problem is acknowledged.
**LRT**: The overgeneration problem is solved by derivational specificity.

## Why This Matters

Reading Tahko made me realize that LRT isn't philosophically isolated. It's taking a serious metaphysical position - one with a literature, defenders, and ongoing debates - and showing it has physical teeth.

The key move: elevating logical realism from "interesting philosophy" to "falsifiable physics."

If someone could demonstrate a macroscopic P∧¬P - a detector simultaneously reading contradictory outcomes - LRT would be refuted. That's not something most metaphysical positions can say.

---

## For Further Reading

Tahko's paper is accessible and well-organized. If you're interested in the philosophical foundations that LRT builds on, it's worth the read.

The connection between logical realism and quantum mechanics is, as far as I know, novel. LRT may be wrong, but it's not philosophically naive. It's taking established positions seriously and drawing consequences.
