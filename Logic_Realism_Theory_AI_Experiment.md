## Abstract

This document describes the dual nature of the Logic Realism Theory (LRT) research program: (1) an experiment in AI-enabled theoretical physics development using Claude Code and multi-LLM consultation, and (2) an exploration of grounding quantum mechanics in primitive logical and information-theoretic systems. We present transparent methodology, empirical assessment of collaboration patterns, and lessons learned for both approaches.

**Core Question 1 (Methodological)**: How can AI collaboration enhance rigor, exploration, and documentation in theoretical physics?

**Core Question 2 (Theoretical)**: Can quantum mechanics be derived from primitive logical filtering of information spaces?

**Key Insight**: This is an EXPERIMENT. Both successes and challenges provide valuable data about human-AI collaboration in foundational research.

## 1. Dual Nature of the Program

### 1.1 Approach 1: AI-Enabled Theoretical Physics Experiment

**Hypothesis**: Advanced AI systems (Claude Code, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) can serve as collaborative research partners in theoretical physics, enhancing rigor and accelerating exploration.

**Methodology**:
- **Primary AI Partner**: Claude Code (Anthropic) for development, derivation, and proof work
- **Validation Layer**: Multi-LLM team consultation (quality threshold ≥ 0.70)
- **Documentation**: Version-controlled theory development with comprehensive session logging
- **Rigor Enforcement**: AI-Collaboration-Profile.json defining critical review standards
- **Integration**: Computational validation (Python/Jupyter) + formal proofs (Lean 4)

**What Makes This Experimental**:
- AI proposes derivations, identifies potential issues, suggests mathematical structures
- Human-AI collaboration ratio varies by task (exploration vs directed work)
- Systematic documentation of collaboration patterns and outcomes
- Iterative refinement of collaboration protocols based on lessons learned

**Success Criterion**: Can we produce peer-review-ready physics with novel testable predictions using this methodology?

### 1.2 Approach 2: Foundational Physics from Primitive Systems

**Hypothesis**: Quantum mechanics can be derived from logical filtering of infinite information spaces, minimizing phenomenological assumptions.

**Core Thesis**: **A = L(I)**
- **A**: Actualization (physical reality)
- **L**: Logical operators (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle)
- **I**: Infinite information space

**Philosophical Motivation**:
- Most fundamental explanation: What is the minimal structure needed for physics?
- Information-theoretic foundations: Reality as constraint-filtered information
- Testability: Derive phenomenological parameters from first principles

**Key Prediction**: **T₂/T₁ ≈ 0.81** (decoherence-to-relaxation ratio in superconducting qubits)
- Derived from coupling parameter η ≈ 0.23 via variational optimization
- Status: Theoretically motivated hypothesis (hybrid LRT + QM + thermodynamics)
- Represents progress toward first-principles derivation

**Success Criterion**: Can we derive measurable quantum phenomena without phenomenological fitting?

## 2. Methodology: How AI Collaboration Works

### 2.1 Development Workflow

**Session-Based Research**:
1. Session begins with context loading: AI-Collaboration-Profile, latest session log, active sprint docs
2. Work proceeds with AI proposing approaches, human guiding direction and making strategic decisions
3. Multi-LLM team validates critical results (quality ≥ 0.70 required)
4. Session log documents: decisions, derivations, approaches tried, lessons learned
5. All work committed to GitHub with comprehensive documentation

**Sprint Structure** (for multi-week projects):
- Sprint planning documents (objectives, phases, deliverables)
- Progress tracking with explicit completion criteria
- Multi-LLM consultations at key decision points
- Iterative refinement based on lessons learned

**Quality Gates**:
- **Lean proofs**: Clear distinction between "builds successfully" and "formally verified"
- **Derivations**: Explicitly state what's derived vs assumed
- **Validation claims**: Require multi-LLM team review (≥ 0.70) for critical results
- **AI-Collaboration-Profile**: Critical review mode, identify potential issues, request verification

### 2.2 Human vs AI Contributions

**Human Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Strategic direction (which problems to tackle, when to pivot)

## 3. Current Status: Evidence-Based Assessment

### 3.1 Theoretical Progress

**Achievements**:
- ✅ Core framework: A = L(I) formulated and documented
- ✅ Conceptual derivations: ~9,000 lines of informal arguments for ℂℙⁿ, Born rule, Schrödinger equation
- ✅ Testable prediction: T₂/T₁ ≈ 0.81 for superconducting qubits
- ✅ Axiom inventory: Clear accounting of assumptions (19 total: 2 Tier 1, ~16 Tier 2, 1 Tier 3)
- ✅ Computational validation: Notebooks execute, simulations work
- ✅ Formal structure: Lean formalization builds successfully (6096 jobs, 0 errors)

**Remaining Work**:
- ⏸️ Formal verification: Infrastructure proofs complete (Foundation/), major theorems pending (14 sorry)
  - Born rule theorems: Documented with proof obligations
  - Schrödinger equation: Structured awaiting infrastructure
  - Infrastructure gaps identified (structure implementations needed)
- ⏸️ Pure first-principles: η derivation uses environmental parameters (progress but not complete)
- ⏸️ K-value justification: K=0.1, K=1.0 have theoretical motivation, awaiting full derivation
- ⏸️ Experimental validation: T₂/T₁ ≈ 0.81 prediction ready for lab testing

**Overall Assessment**:
- **Conceptual Progress**: Strong foundation established
- **Formal Verification**: Infrastructure complete, theorem proofs in progress
- **Status**: Exploration phase successful, rigor phase underway

### 3.2 AI Collaboration Patterns Observed

**Documented Strengths**:
1. **Systematic Exploration**: Can explore multiple approaches methodically (Sprint 7: 35 approaches documented)
2. **Infrastructure Development**: Successfully wrote complete proofs for foundation modules (Distinguishability, Actualization, IIS: 0 sorry)
3. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive session logs provide unprecedented audit trail (~15,000+ lines)
4. **Protocol Adherence**: When given clear verification protocols, follows them effectively (Sprint 12 Sanity Check)
5. **Refactoring Capability**: Successfully performed systematic axiom reduction (Sprint 12: -13 axioms via tier classification)

**Observed Limitations**:
1. **Terminology Precision**: Initial tendency to use "complete" for partial work (addressed via protocols)
2. **Verification Emphasis**: Need for explicit protocols distinguishing compilation from proof (added to CLAUDE.md)
3. **Complexity Thresholds**: Some proofs require infrastructure not yet available (14 sorry statements infrastructure-blocked)
4. **Meta-Work Balance**: Time investment in process creation vs direct research work (ongoing calibration)

**Key Discovery - Collaboration Dynamics**:
- AI naturally produces high volumes of exploration and documentation
- Human guidance essential for focusing effort on high-value technical work
- Clear verification protocols prevent misunderstandings about completion status
- Iterative protocol refinement improves collaboration over time

**Lessons Learned**:
1. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Clear definitions of "complete," "verified," "proven" prevent miscommunication
2. **Infrastructure matters**: Many blocked proofs need structure implementations, not just proof attempts
3. **Protocols evolve**: Sanity Check Protocol (Sprint 12) addresses lessons from earlier sprints
4. **Balance is key**: Documentation enables rigor, but must not substitute for technical work
5. **Outcome focus**: Track results (theorems proven, axioms reduced), not process (lines written)

## 4. Lessons Learned: What This Experiment Reveals

### 4.1 Effective Collaboration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Systematic Refactoring** (Sprint 12 success)
- **Observation**: Tier classification system reduced 32→19 axioms systematically
- **Lesson**: Wholesale refactoring more effective than piecemeal fixes
- **Application**: Use AI for systematic restructuring tasks with clear criteria

**Pattern 2: Protocol-Driven Quality** (Sprint 12 success)
- **Observation**: Sanity Check Protocol prevented overclaiming before it occurred
- **Lesson**: Explicit verification steps improve collaboration outcomes
- **Application**: Develop verification protocols for critical claims

**Pattern 3: Infrastructure-First Strategy** (Sprint 12 finding)
- **Observation**: 14 sorry statements blocked by missing structures, not proof difficulty
- **Lesson**: Complete infrastructure before attempting dependent proofs
- **Application**: Test-driven approach (attempt proof early to identify blockers)

**Pattern 4: Outcome-Focused Metrics** (Sprint 12 shift)
- **Observation**: Tracking "axioms reduced" and "theorems proven" more meaningful than "lines written"
- **Lesson**: Measure research outcomes, not activity indicators
- **Application**: Define success criteria as concrete technical achievements

### 4.2 Collaboration Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Terminology Ambiguity**
- **Issue**: Terms like "complete," "verified," "formalized" have precise meanings in formal methods
- **Impact**: Early sessions conflated "builds successfully" with "formally verified"
- **Solution**: Added Lean Formalization Verification Protocol to CLAUDE.md (2025-11-04)
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved (terminology now precise and consistent)

**Challenge 2: Meta-Work vs Object-Work Balance**
- **Issue**: Time spent on documentation and process can grow without bounds
- **Impact**: Sprint 12 Track 3 focused on documentation updates (necessary but meta-work)
- **Solution**: Question each new protocol: "What specific risk does this prevent?"
- **Status**: ⏸️ Ongoing calibration (documentation valuable but must balance with research)

**Challenge 3: Infrastructure Dependency Discovery**
- **Issue**: Proof attempts reveal missing structures only when attempted
- **Impact**: Cannot complete proofs without implementing dependent structures first
- **Solution**: Test-driven formalization (attempt proof early to discover blockers)
- **Status**: ✅ Strategy adopted (Sprint 12 Phase 2 identified blockers systematically)

**Challenge 4: Capability Boundaries**
- **Issue**: Unclear where AI capability limits lie for complex formal proofs
- **Impact**: Cannot assess difficulty vs capability without attempting
- **Solution**: Infrastructure completion will enable testing capability boundaries
- **Status**: ⏸️ To be determined (infrastructure gaps prevent current assessment)

### 4.3 Validated Best Practices
