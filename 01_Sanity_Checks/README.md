# Sanity Check Reports

This folder contains all sanity check protocol reports run on tracks, derivations, and deliverables.

## Purpose

Sanity checks verify actual completion vs claimed completion. Every report documents:
- Build status
- Proof verification (sorry count)
- Import verification
- Axiom count reality
- Deliverable reality check
- Professional tone
- Experimental literature cross-check (for predictions)
- Computational circularity check (for simulations)
- Comprehensive circularity check (for all work)

## File Naming Convention

**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_[TrackName]_SanityCheck.md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-11-06_Energy_SanityCheck.md`
- `2025-11-06_K_ID_Derivation_SanityCheck.md`
- `2025-11-06_Sprint13_Track2_SanityCheck.md`

## When to Save Reports

**MANDATORY**: After completing ANY of these:
- Sprint track
- Major derivation
- Lean formalization module
- Computational validation
- Experimental prediction

**DO NOT** claim completion without:
1. Running the sanity check protocol
2. Saving the report to this folder
3. Addressing any failures (❌) found

## Report Structure

Each report follows the template in `SANITY_CHECK_PROTOCOL.md`:
- 9 quick checks (Build, Proof, Import, Axiom, Deliverable, Tone, Literature, Computational, Circularity)
- Pass/fail status for each
- Honest assessment
- Proceed? decision

## Historical Record

This folder serves as an audit trail showing:
- What was checked
- When it was checked
- What passed/failed
- How issues were resolved

Peer reviewers and collaborators can review these reports to understand the verification rigor applied throughout the project.
