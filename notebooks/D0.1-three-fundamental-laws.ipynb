    "This notebook establishes the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (L\u2083)** as self-grounding primitives for Logic Realism Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Demonstrate that L\u2083 cannot be denied without presupposing them, making them the irreducible foundation for all subsequent derivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Claim**: L\u2083 are not derived from more fundamental principles\u2014they ARE the most fundamental principles."

    "### L\u2082: Law of Non-Contradiction\n",

    "**Statement**: For any proposition A: \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acA)\n",

    "\n",
    "A principle P is **self-grounding** if:\n",
    "1. Any attempt to deny P must presuppose P\n",
    "2. P cannot be derived from more fundamental principles\n",
    "3. P is required for coherent thought/being itself\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 L\u2081 (Identity) is Self-Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argument**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose someone denies L\u2081: \"It is not the case that A = A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this denial to be meaningful:\n",
    "- The denier must use 'A' to refer to something\n",
    "- That something must be identifiable as the same thing in both occurrences\n",
    "- Therefore, the denial presupposes A = A\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: L\u2081 cannot be coherently denied. \u2713\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 L\u2082 (Non-Contradiction) is Self-Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argument**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose someone asserts: \"L\u2082 is false\" (i.e., contradictions can be true)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assertion to be meaningful:\n",
    "- The assertion must be distinguishable from its negation\n",
    "- \"L\u2082 is false\" must NOT simultaneously mean \"L\u2082 is true\"\n",
    "- If contradictions were allowed, the denial would also affirm L\u2082\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: Denying L\u2082 makes all assertions meaningless, including the denial itself. \u2713\n",

    "\n",
    "**Argument**:\n",

    "Suppose someone denies L\u2083: \"There are propositions that are neither true nor false\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider: Is this denial true or false?\n",
    "- If true: At least one proposition has a definite truth value (contradicting the claim)\n",
    "- If neither: The denial doesn't assert anything\n",
