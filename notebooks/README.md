# Logic Realism Theory - Computational Notebooks

**Copyright © 2025 James D. (JD) Longmire**
**License**: Apache License 2.0

This folder contains the computational validation suite for Logic Realism Theory (LRT).

## Notebook Sequence (9 Total)

### Foundation (01-02)
- **01_IIS_and_3FLL.ipynb** - Infinite Information Space and Three Fundamental Laws
- **02_Operator_Formalism.ipynb** - Π_id, {Π_i}, R operators

### Derivations (03-07)
- **03_Time_Emergence.ipynb** - Time from Stone's theorem
- **04_Energy_Constraint.ipynb** - Energy from Spohn's inequality
- **05_Born_Rule.ipynb** - Born rule from maximum entropy
- **06_Quantum_Superposition.ipynb** - Partial constraint → superposition
- **07_Measurement_Problem.ipynb** - Full constraint → classical state

### Predictions & Bridge (08-09)
- **08_Beta_Prediction.ipynb** - β ≠ 0 in quantum error correction (PRIMARY TESTABLE PREDICTION)
- **09_SN_Realization.ipynb** - Bridge to Approach 2 (S_N hierarchy)

## Approach vs. Approach 2

**Approach 2** (Physical Logic Framework): 25 notebooks, ~80,000 words
- Comprehensive computational exploration
- All notebooks archived in `../approach_2_reference/notebooks/`

**Logic Realism Theory** (this folder): 9 notebooks, ~42,000 words (target)
- Focused on core derivations
- References Approach 2 for computational validation
- Professional scholarly tone throughout

## Copyright Format (3 Lines)

All notebooks must use this exact format:

```markdown
**Copyright © 2025 James D. (JD) Longmire**
**License**: Apache License 2.0
**Citation**: Longmire, J.D. (2025). *Logic Realism Theory: Deriving Quantum Mechanics from Logical Consistency*. Logic Realism Theory Repository.
```

## Professional Tone Guidelines

**DO**:
- Present correct approach directly
- Use scholarly, professional language
- Explain reasoning clearly
- Reference Approach 2 results where applicable

**DO NOT**:
- Include thinking commentary ("Wait, that doesn't seem right...")
- Include self-corrections ("Let me recalculate...", "Actually, this is wrong...")
- Use stream-of-consciousness style

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to desired notebook and execute cells sequentially.

## Outputs

Generated figures and data are saved to `outputs/` (gitignored except .gitkeep).

## Reference: Approach 2 Archive

For complete computational validation of concepts, see:
- `../approach_2_reference/notebooks/` - 25 notebooks with detailed explorations
- Reference these notebooks but maintain clean LRT framing
