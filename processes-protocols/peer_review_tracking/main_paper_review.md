### Abstract

Every physical measurement ever conducted has yielded exactly one outcome: self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. This holds across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry, including a century of quantum mechanics where violations were actively sought. This paper argues that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle) are not cognitive conventions but ontological constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability. From this thesis, quantum mechanics emerges as the unique stable structure at the interface between non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality. The framework derives rather than postulates: complex Hilbert space structure follows from interface constraints combined with the physical requirement of compositional consistency (local tomography); the Born rule follows from Gleason's theorem; unitary dynamics follows from information preservation requirements.

## 6. Anticipated Reviewer Concerns

### Concern 1: Derivation vs Postulation Claims
**Severity**: MAJOR

> **Concern**: Scope of claims - is this really "derivation" or does it smuggle in assumptions?

**Prepared Response**: Framework explicitly acknowledges physical inputs (local tomography, continuity) alongside logical inputs (3FLL). Claim is structural selection, not derivation from logic alone. See §1.5 and §3.

---

### Concern 2: AI Methodology Credibility
**Severity**: MODERATE

> **Concern**: How can AI-assisted work be trusted for rigorous theory development?

**Prepared Response**: Full disclosure provided. Multi-LLM adversarial review + human governance + citation validation + Lean 4 formalization (planned). Defense-in-depth verification documented in `LRT_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`.

---

### Concern 3: Relationship to Reconstruction Theorems
**Severity**: MAJOR

> **Concern**: How does this relate to existing axiomatic reconstructions (Hardy, Masanes-Müller, Chiribella)?

**Prepared Response**: Paper builds on Hardy (2001), Masanes-Müller (2011), Chiribella et al. (2011). Novel contribution is grounding physical axioms in logical constitution via 3FLL. Technical paper provides rigorous derivation chain.

---

### Concern 4: Testability and Falsifiability
**Severity**: MODERATE

> **Concern**: Is this falsifiable science or unfalsifiable philosophy?

**Prepared Response**: 12 explicit falsifiers enumerated in §6. One structural prediction (complex QM) already confirmed (Renou et al. 2021). Framework stakes itself on testable predictions, not unfalsifiable philosophy.

---

### Concern 5: Interface Criterion
**Severity**: MAJOR

> **Concern**: When exactly does actualization occur? This seems like an open problem.

**Prepared Response**: Acknowledged as open problem (§7). Framework provides structural constraints on interface, not complete solution. This is explicit limitation, not hidden weakness.

---

### Concern 6: Circularity Objection
**Severity**: MAJOR

> **Concern**: Doesn't using classical apparatus to verify 3FLL presuppose 3FLL?

**Prepared Response**: Addressed in Main §2.9 'The Circularity Objection'. Observation vs explanation distinction. We observe 3FLL conformity; LRT explains it. Alternative treats conformity as brute cosmic coincidence.
