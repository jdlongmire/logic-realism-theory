# Logic Realism Theory

Physical Foundations from Logical Constraints — deriving quantum mechanics from the three classical laws of logic.

---

## The Theory in Brief

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) treats the three classical laws of logic not as rules of inference but as **ontological constraints on physical instantiation**. No stable experimental record — across the entire history of science — has ever violated them.

| Law | Constraint |
|-----|------------|
| **Determinate Identity (Id)** | Every entity is determinately what it is |
| **Non-Contradiction (NC)** | No entity is both P and not-P in the same respect |
| **Excluded Middle (EM)** | Every entity is either P or not-P |

LRT distinguishes two domains: **I-infinity** (all representable configurations, including contradictions) and **A-Omega** (the L3-admissible subset that can be physically instantiated as stable records). The boundary between them generates quantum structure:

- **Vehicle-invariance** under equivalent decompositions forces the **Born rule** via Gleason's theorem
- **Local tomography** requirements select **complex Hilbert space** over real alternatives
- **Symmetrization** of identical particles yields bosonic and fermionic sectors
- **Tsirelson bound** emerges as a mathematical consequence, not an empirical postulate

The derivation chain: **L3 → Distinguishability → Hilbert Space → Born Rule → Quantum Mechanics**

The framework is falsifiable: a single stable record instantiating a direct L3 violation would refute it. LRT derives (not merely accommodates) the structure of quantum mechanics.
