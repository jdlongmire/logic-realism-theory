## Abstract

This paper extends Logic Realism Theory (LRT) to quantum mechanics, arguing that quantum structure is the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality. The companion paper established that the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) are constitutive of physical reality. Here we develop the implications: actuality requires Boolean determinacy, but IIS contains richer structures including indeterminate states. Quantum mechanics - specifically complex Hilbert space with the Born rule - provides the interface between these domains. This is not derived from logic alone but represents structural fine-tuning: perturbations to quantum structure destroy stable physics. The paper dissolves several foundational puzzles (measurement, entanglement, wave function reality) and grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" in logical foundations. The bit - the fundamental unit of distinction - derives from 3FLL. Quantum mechanics is what bit-structure looks like when interfacing with Boolean actuality. It from bit; bit from fit.

## 1. Introduction

The companion paper - "Logic Realism Theory: The Ontological Status of the Laws of Logic" - established a philosophical foundation: the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle) are not cognitive conventions but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. It introduced the Infinite Information Space (IIS) as co-primitive with 3FLL, and formalized the framework as:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{P}(\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{I}))$$

Where actuality ($\mathcal{A}$) emerges from constitutive constraints ($\mathfrak{C}$) applied to the space of possibilities ($\mathcal{I}$), filtered by parsimony ($\mathfrak{P}$).

This paper asks: what does this framework imply for physics? Specifically, why does physical reality exhibit quantum structure rather than classical structure, or some other structure entirely?

The answer we develop is not a derivation. We do not show that quantum mechanics follows necessarily from 3FLL. Instead, we show something more modest but still significant:

1. **IIS contains many possible structures**, including classical probability, quantum mechanics, and others.

2. **Actuality requires Boolean outcomes** - determinate, non-contradictory, complete - as 3FLL demand.

3. **Multiple structures can interface with Boolean actuality**, satisfying the formal constraints.

4. **Quantum mechanics is the unique structure that produces stable physics** - atoms, chemistry, observers, inquiry.

5. **This is fine-tuning at the structural level** - perturbations to quantum structure destroy physical stability.

6. **Wheeler's "it from bit" is thereby grounded** - the bit (fundamental distinction) derives from 3FLL; quantum mechanics is what bit-structure looks like actualized.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the two-domain ontology (IIS and actuality). Section 3 analyzes distinguishability and the bit. Sections 4-6 address the interface problem, quantum structure, and the Born rule. Section 7 dissolves foundational puzzles. Section 8 examines quantum fields. Section 9 develops the fine-tuning thesis. Section 10 grounds Wheeler. Section 11 shows how LRT completes related programs. Section 12 provides honest accounting of what is derived versus fine-tuned. Section 13 concludes.

## 2. The Two Domains

### 2.1 Infinite Information Space

IIS is the totality of logically distinguishable states - every possible informational configuration constituted by 3FLL. Several features are essential:

**IIS is not Boolean.** While 3FLL constitute distinguishability, they do not constrain IIS to binary structure. IIS contains:

- Determinate states (fully specified configurations)
- Indeterminate states (distinguishable but not resolved to definite values)
- Superpositions (specific indeterminate states with interference structure)
- Classical mixtures (probabilistic combinations without interference)

**IIS is structured by distinguishability.** The "metric" on IIS is how distinguishable states are from each other. This is inherently relational - comparing two states - and therefore quadratic in character.

**IIS contains all possible mathematical structures.** Classical probability theory lives in IIS. So does quantum mechanics. So do structures we have not named. IIS is the space of what can be distinguished, not what is actual.

### 2.2 Boolean Actuality

Actuality is the domain where 3FLL are fully enforced. Any physical state of affairs - any event, measurement outcome, or determinate fact - must satisfy:

**Identity:** The state is what it is; it has determinate properties.

**Non-Contradiction:** The state does not simultaneously have and lack the same property.

**Excluded Middle:** For any well-defined property, the state either has it or does not.

This means actuality is **Boolean** - every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value. The actual world is a consistent, determinate configuration.

### 2.3 The Asymmetry

Here is the key insight: **3FLL constitute IIS but only constrain actuality to be Boolean.**

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties. These are not contradictions - they are genuinely indeterminate configurations.

Actuality, by contrast, must be fully determinate. When something becomes actual - when it manifests physically - it must satisfy 3FLL completely.

This creates an **interface problem**: how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?

---

## 3. Distinguishability and the Bit

### 3.1 Distinguishability Is Constituted by 3FLL

Without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle, there is no basis for one state to be different from another. Distinguishability is not a primitive fact discovered in the world; it is what 3FLL establish.

Consider: for state A to be distinguishable from state B, we need:
- A = A and B = B (identity)
- A ≠ B (non-identity, which presupposes identity)
- It is not the case that A = B and A ≠ B (non-contradiction)

Distinguishability just is the application of 3FLL to a domain.

### 3.2 Distinguishability Is Pairwise

To distinguish is to compare. Distinguishability is inherently a relation between two things: how different is A from B? This relational character means distinguishability has **quadratic structure** - it involves pairs, not individuals.

This observation is crucial for understanding why quantum mechanics has the structure it does.

### 3.3 The Bit as Fundamental Unit

The **bit** is the minimal unit of distinguishability - one binary distinction. In LRT terms:

- One bit = the information required to distinguish between two alternatives
- The bit is not derived from physics; physics is derived from bits
- The grain of actuality is the bit - you cannot have half a distinction

This connects to Wheeler's "it from bit": physical reality emerges from yes/no questions. LRT grounds this insight: the yes/no question is the fundamental logical operation, and 3FLL constitute what makes such questions meaningful.

### 3.4 The Bit Scale

If the bit is the fundamental unit of distinguishability, and physical action is measured in units of ℏ (Planck's constant), then ℏ may be understood as the **conversion factor between logical and physical structure**:

$$S = \hbar \cdot C$$

Where S is action (physical) and C is complexity (informational, measured in bits).

This is conjectural but supported by independent results. The **Bekenstein bound** states that the maximum entropy (information content) of a region is proportional to its surface area in Planck units:

$$S_{\text{max}} = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 G \hbar}$$

This implies a maximum bit density per Planck area - roughly one bit per Planck area. If ℏ is the bit-action conversion factor, this bound follows naturally: physical regions have finite action capacity, hence finite bit capacity.

Similarly, **black hole entropy** (the Bekenstein-Hawking formula) gives entropy proportional to horizon area in Planck units. In LRT terms: the horizon bounds the distinguishability capacity of the interior.

These connections suggest:
- One bit of complexity corresponds to approximately ℏ of action
- The classical world appears continuous because specifying it exactly would require infinite bits
- The Planck scale marks where the bit-structure of reality becomes directly relevant
- The holographic principle reflects fundamental limits on distinguishability density

## 4. The Interface Problem

### 4.1 Many Structures Satisfy the Constraints

For any structure in IIS to interface with Boolean actuality, it must permit a map from its states to binary outcomes. This map must satisfy:

1. **Totality** (from Excluded Middle): defined for all states
2. **Single-valuedness** (from Non-Contradiction): no contradictory outputs
3. **Distinguishability-preservation** (from Identity): different states can yield different outputs

Classical probability satisfies these constraints. A probability distribution over outcomes, sampled to yield a definite result, produces Boolean actuality from a richer structure.

Quantum mechanics also satisfies these constraints. A quantum state, measured in some basis, yields a definite outcome according to the Born rule.

### 4.2 The Selection Problem

If multiple structures satisfy the formal interface constraints, what selects among them?

The answer is not logical necessity. Logic does not dictate that reality must be quantum rather than classical. The selection is **empirical** - we observe that reality is quantum.

But this raises a deeper question: why does quantum structure, rather than classical structure, produce stable physics?

### 4.3 Parsimony as Selection Principle

The thesis equation from the companion paper includes a parsimony operator (𝔓):

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{P}(\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{I}))$$

Parsimony selects among the paths through IIS that satisfy 3FLL constraints. But why parsimony?

**The natural metric argument:** IIS is a space of distinguishable states constituted by 3FLL. The only intrinsic measure on such a space is **complexity** - how much information is required to specify a state or path. Parsimony (selecting for minimal complexity) is therefore the natural metric on IIS. Any other selection principle would require importing external criteria.

**The non-arbitrariness argument:** Consider alternative selection principles:
- Maximal complexity: Selects the most elaborate paths. But "most elaborate" requires a bound, which introduces arbitrariness.
- Random selection: Provides no explanation for the structured regularity we observe.
- Aesthetic criteria: What counts as "beautiful" or "elegant" is undefined without a prior standard.
- External design: Introduces entities beyond the framework.

Parsimony is the only principle that is both non-arbitrary and intrinsic to an information space.

**The empirical fit argument:** Physical laws are remarkably compressible. The Standard Model, general relativity, and thermodynamics can all be expressed in compact mathematical form. The universe exhibits structured simplicity, not random complexity. This is what parsimony selection predicts.

**The stability connection:** The companion paper argued that parsimony connects to stability through the variational principle - paths that minimize action are stable, and action correlates with informational complexity. If S = ℏC (action = Planck constant × complexity), then parsimony selection is equivalent to the principle of least action.

**Remaining questions:** We acknowledge that parsimony is not fully derived from 3FLL alone. It may be:
- A brute feature of how actuality selects from possibility
- Emergent from a deeper principle we have not identified
- The only principle consistent with stable actuality (in which case it would be indirectly derived)

For present purposes, we treat parsimony as the most plausible selection principle and note that it is assumed rather than proven.

## 5. Why Quantum Structure Survives

### 5.1 Classical Structure Is Compatible but Unstable

Classical probability, applied at the fundamental level, does not produce stable atoms. Without interference effects:

- Electrons would spiral into nuclei (no stable orbitals)
- No discrete energy levels (no chemistry)
- No tunneling (no stellar fusion)
- No identical particles (no periodic table)

Classical structure satisfies the Boolean interface constraint but does not produce observers capable of noticing.

### 5.2 Quantum Structure Produces Stability

Quantum mechanics - specifically, complex Hilbert space with unitary evolution and the Born rule - produces:

- Stable atoms (discrete energy levels from wave interference)
- Chemistry (electron orbitals, bonding)
- Solid matter (Pauli exclusion, fermion statistics)
- Stars (quantum tunneling enables fusion)
- Observers (stable structures capable of inquiry)

### 5.3 This Is Fine-Tuning

The relationship between quantum structure and physical stability is not necessary - it is fine-tuned. Consider what perturbations would destroy:

| Perturbation | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Remove complex numbers | No interference; no stable atoms |
| Alter unitarity | Norms blow up or decay; no stable evolution |
| Change Born exponent from 2 | No valid probability measure |
| Use quaternions instead | Lose tomographic locality |
| Use reals instead | Lose interference; classical behavior |
| Perturb linearity | Superluminal signaling possible |
| Alter commutation relations | Pathological spectra; no stable matter |
| Remove Hilbert completeness | No well-defined dynamics |

Quantum mechanics sits on a razor's edge. The structure must be exactly as it is for physics to be stable.

### 5.3.1 The Anthropic Character of Stability Selection

We must be explicit about what "stability" means here. The argument is:

1. Only quantum structure produces stable atoms, chemistry, observers
2. We are observers
3. Therefore we observe quantum structure

This has the form of the **Weak Anthropic Principle**: we necessarily find ourselves in conditions compatible with our existence. Critics may object that this is circular or tautological.

The response: we are not claiming quantum structure is *logically necessary*. We are claiming it is *observationally necessary* - necessary for there to be observations at all. This is not a derivation but a selection effect.

The selection is genuine. Consider:
- IIS contains many possible structures (classical, quantum, others)
- Most do not produce stable matter
- The ones that do are the ones that can be observed
- We observe quantum structure

This parallels cosmic fine-tuning arguments. We do not derive the value of the fine-structure constant α from first principles. We note that if α were different, no atoms - and therefore no observers to measure α. The "explanation" is selection, not derivation.

LRT adds something to this picture: it situates the selection at the level of mathematical structure, not just parameters. The question "why quantum mechanics?" becomes parallel to "why these constants?" - both are fine-tuning facts, with structural fine-tuning being more fundamental.

We do not claim this fully explains why quantum structure exists. We claim it explains why we observe it: because it is the unique structure compatible with observers existing to ask the question.

### 5.4 Evidence from Reconstruction Theorems

The uniqueness of quantum structure is not merely asserted - it is supported by rigorous results in quantum foundations.

**Hardy (2001):** Derived quantum theory from five "reasonable axioms" including continuous reversibility and tomographic locality. The result: only quantum mechanics satisfies all five.

**Chiribella, D'Ariano, Perinotti (2011):** Derived quantum theory from informational axioms. Key finding: quantum theory is the unique theory satisfying causality, perfect distinguishability, ideal compression, local distinguishability, and pure conditioning.

**Masanes and Müller (2011):** Showed that quantum theory is the unique theory with:
- Continuous reversible dynamics
- Local tomography (state determined by local measurements)
- Existence of entangled states

**Dakić and Brukner (2011):** Derived quantum theory from three axioms about information capacity and continuity.

These reconstruction theorems converge on the same conclusion: quantum mechanics is not one possibility among many but the **unique** structure satisfying certain natural constraints.

In LRT terms: the constraints these theorems identify are features required for stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. Continuous reversibility preserves information in IIS. Local tomography ensures consistency across subsystems. The theorems do not derive quantum mechanics from logic alone, but they show that quantum structure is uniquely determined once reasonable interface requirements are imposed.

### 5.5 Structural Fine-Tuning

This is fine-tuning at a deeper level than usually discussed:

**Cosmic fine-tuning** concerns constants: if the fine-structure constant α were slightly different, no stable atoms. If the cosmological constant Λ were much larger, no galaxies.

**Quantum fine-tuning** concerns the mathematical framework itself: if the structure of quantum mechanics were slightly different, no physics at all.

Structural fine-tuning is more fundamental. The constants are parameters within the framework; the framework itself must be precisely tuned for any parameters to matter.

## 6. The Born Rule

### 6.1 The Interface Is Quadratic

Distinguishability is pairwise, therefore quadratic. The natural structure on a space of distinguishable states is an **inner product** - a function that takes two vectors and returns a number measuring their relation.

For complex Hilbert space, the inner product is:

$$\langle\psi|\phi\rangle$$

This is sesquilinear (linear in one argument, conjugate-linear in the other), which ensures:

$$\langle\psi|\psi\rangle \geq 0$$

The norm is automatically non-negative.

### 6.2 Born Rule as Unique Interface

Given a Hilbert space structure, **Gleason's theorem** shows that the only possible probability measure is:

$$P(\text{outcome}) = |\langle\text{outcome}|\psi\rangle|^2$$

This is the Born rule. It is not an additional postulate - it is the unique way to assign probabilities to outcomes in a Hilbert space framework.

### 6.3 The Conditionality

The Born rule follows from Hilbert space structure. But Hilbert space structure is fine-tuned, not derived. So:

- **Given** Hilbert space: Born rule is derived (Gleason)
- **Hilbert space itself**: Fine-tuned (unique stable structure)

The derivation is conditional. We explain what follows from quantum structure, not why quantum structure exists.

## 7. Dissolutions

LRT does not solve the foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics in the sense of providing new dynamics or hidden variables. It dissolves them - showing that the puzzles arise from mistaken framings.

### 7.1 Measurement

**The puzzle:** How does the smooth, deterministic evolution of the wave function produce discrete, random measurement outcomes? What constitutes a "measurement"? When does "collapse" occur?

**The dissolution:** There is no mysterious collapse mechanism. Measurement is the interface between IIS and Boolean actuality.

In IIS, the quantum state evolves unitarily. When the state interacts with a context that requires Boolean outcomes - a detector, an irreversible record, a macroscopic system - 3FLL are enforced. The state must become determinate.

This is not a dynamical process requiring new physics. It is a **category transition** - from the IIS domain (where indeterminacy is permitted) to the actuality domain (where it is not).

The "measurement problem" dissolves because collapse is not a process but an interface. The question "when does collapse occur?" is like asking "when does the map become the territory?" - it reflects a category confusion.

### 7.1.1 What LRT Does and Does Not Provide

We must be precise about what this dissolution accomplishes.

**What LRT provides:**
- An ontological interpretation of what collapse IS (category transition, not dynamical process)
- An explanation of why definite outcomes occur (3FLL enforcement)
- A reason why no new physics is needed (it is not a physical process)

**What LRT does not provide:**
- A precise physical criterion for when the transition occurs
- A derivation of the quantum-classical boundary
- An explanation of why THIS outcome rather than THAT outcome

The question "when exactly does Boolean actuality get enforced?" remains open. Candidate answers from the literature include:

| Criterion | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Decoherence | Zurek, Zeh |
| Irreversible amplification | Daneri-Loinger-Prosperi |
| Thermodynamic gradient | Various |
| Gravitational threshold | Penrose |
| Information transfer to environment | Quantum Darwinism |

LRT is compatible with any of these as the physical marker of the transition. What LRT adds is the interpretation: whatever the physical criterion, what happens is category transition, not collapse dynamics.

This is analogous to how thermodynamics relates to statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics says entropy increases; statistical mechanics says how (coarse-graining, typicality). LRT says outcomes become determinate; decoherence (or another mechanism) may specify when.

The remaining question - why THIS outcome? - may have no answer. If the selection among outcomes satisfying 3FLL is genuinely stochastic (irreducibly random), then "why this one?" has no deeper explanation. The Born rule gives probabilities; it may not admit further grounding.

### 7.2 Entanglement and Non-Locality

**The puzzle:** Entangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables (Bell's theorem). Measuring one particle seems to instantaneously affect the other, regardless of distance. How can this be, given that no signal travels faster than light?

**The dissolution:** There is no "spooky action at a distance" because there is no action.

In LRT, 3FLL operate as a **global constraint field**. They do not propagate from place to place like a signal; they simply hold, everywhere, always. An entangled state is a single configuration in IIS with extended properties - not two separate things mysteriously connected.

When measurement occurs, 3FLL enforce consistency across the entire state. The correlations are not caused by one particle signaling the other; they are **constraint satisfaction**, not communication.

### 7.2.0 Constraints Are Not Hidden Variables

This framing might sound like non-local hidden variables (as in Bohmian mechanics). It is not. The distinction is crucial:

**A variable** has a value. Hidden variable theories posit that particles have definite properties (position, momentum) that we simply do not know. The "hidden" refers to our ignorance.

**A constraint** is a rule. The constraint "A + B = 0" does not assign values to A and B; it specifies a relationship they must satisfy. If we measure A = 3, we immediately know B = -3 - not because a signal traveled from A to B, but because the constraint was always in force.

In LRT:
- The entangled state is a single IIS configuration satisfying certain constraints
- Measurement reveals which values satisfy the constraints
- No signal is needed because the constraint was never "communicated" - it was constitutive of the state

This is why Bell's theorem does not threaten LRT. Bell rules out local hidden *variables* - pre-existing definite values that determine outcomes. LRT does not posit such values. The IIS state is genuinely indeterminate; constraints specify relationships between outcomes, not the outcomes themselves.

The correlations are not explained by hidden information traveling faster than light. They are explained by the unified structure of the IIS state, which does not have spatial parts that need to coordinate. The "non-locality" is in the wholeness of the state, not in any propagation.

This explains why entanglement produces correlations but not signaling. The correlations reflect the logical structure of a unified state. No information travels because there is nothing traveling - just global consistency being enforced.

### 7.2.1 Relativistic Considerations

The "global constraint" picture works naturally in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where simultaneity is well-defined. In relativistic contexts, the situation is more subtle.

**The concern:** General relativity has no preferred foliation of spacetime. "Simultaneous" events depend on reference frame. If 3FLL enforcement is "global," does it require a preferred frame, violating Lorentz invariance?

**The response:** The constraint is on the IIS state, not on spacetime events. The entangled state in IIS is a single configuration; it does not have spatial parts that need to coordinate. The "global" in "global constraint" refers to the logical completeness of constraint satisfaction, not to spatial simultaneity.

When measurement outcomes are registered at spacelike separation, each outcome is locally determinate and globally consistent. The consistency is not achieved by signaling but is a feature of the unified IIS state. Different reference frames will describe the ordering of measurements differently, but all frames agree on the correlations - which is exactly what we observe.

**The limitation:** A fully relativistic formulation of LRT would need to articulate how the IIS/actuality interface respects the causal structure of spacetime. This is non-trivial and represents an open problem for the framework.

Specifically:
- Does the IIS state have a relativistically invariant description?
- How does the category transition (measurement) relate to the light-cone structure?
- Can the framework be extended to quantum field theory in curved spacetime?

These questions parallel open problems in other interpretations (e.g., the preferred foliation in Bohmian mechanics, the basis problem in Everett). LRT does not solve them, but it does not introduce new difficulties either. The framework is consistent with relativistic QFT as standardly practiced; the metaphysical interpretation requires further development.

### 7.3 Many-Worlds Interpretation Obviated

**The puzzle:** If the wave function is real and collapse is not fundamental, what happens to the other branches? MWI says they are equally real - parallel worlds splitting at every measurement.

**The dissolution:** LRT preserves MWI's insights while restoring single actuality.

MWI correctly recognized that:
- The wave function is ontologically real
- Collapse should not be a special mechanism
- There are no hidden variables

LRT agrees with all of this. But LRT does not conclude that all branches are equally actual. Instead:

- Possibilities are real (they exist in IIS)
- One actuality (3FLL enforce a single determinate outcome)
- Other possibilities remain in IIS, not in parallel branches

The "branching" of MWI is reinterpreted as the structure of IIS - all possibilities are there, but only one actualizes. This is not solipsism or hidden variables; it is the distinction between possibility (IIS) and actuality (3FLL-compliant Boolean structure).

### 7.4 Wave Function Reality

**The puzzle:** Is the wave function real (ontological) or merely a description of our knowledge (epistemic)?

**The dissolution:** The wave function is IIS structure - real but not actual.

The wave function ψ describes a genuine configuration in IIS. It is not "just math" or "just our knowledge." But it is also not a physical thing in space like a classical field.

The wave function is real in the sense that IIS is real - it is the structure of possibility constituted by 3FLL. It becomes actual only at the interface, when measurement enforces Boolean determinacy.

### 7.5 Quantization

**The puzzle:** Why are physical quantities (energy, charge, spin) discrete rather than continuous?

**The dissolution:** Actuality is Boolean; the bit is the grain.

In IIS, continuous structures exist. But actuality - what physically manifests - must be determinate. The bit is the minimal unit of determinacy. You cannot have 0.7 of a distinction.

Discrete quantities reflect the Boolean structure of actuality. Energy levels are discrete because the electron either is or is not in a given state. Charge is quantized because the particle either has it or does not. Spin is quantized because the measurement outcome is either up or down.

Quantization is 3FLL at work.

### 7.6 Identical Particles

**The puzzle:** Why are all electrons exactly identical? Classical objects can be arbitrarily similar but always distinguishable in principle. Quantum particles of the same type are absolutely indistinguishable.

**The dissolution:** Quantum fields are modes of distinguishability.

In LRT, quantum fields are not substances but structures - modes of distinguishability in IIS. All electrons are identical because they are excitations of the same mode. There is no "this electron" versus "that electron" at the fundamental level - there is only "electron-mode excitation here" versus "electron-mode excitation there."

The identity of particles follows from the structure of distinguishability itself.

## 8. Quantum Fields as Logical Excitations

### 8.1 The Hierarchy

We can articulate a hierarchy from logic to particles:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0: 3FLL | Ontological foundation - constitutes distinguishability |
| 1: IIS | Structural space - totality of distinguishable states |
| 2: Hilbert Space | Geometric structure - complex vector space with inner product |
| 3: Quantum Fields | Dynamic structure - excitation modes on Hilbert space |
| 4: Particles | Phenomenological - localized excitations of fields |

This inverts the usual picture. We typically think: particles are fundamental; fields describe their interactions; Hilbert space is mathematical formalism; logic is how we reason about it all.

LRT says: logic is fundamental; Hilbert space is what logical distinguishability looks like with interference; fields are modes of excitation; particles are what we observe.

### 8.2 What This Does Not Explain

This hierarchy does not explain:
- Why THESE specific fields (electron, quark, photon, etc.)
- Why THESE gauge groups (U(1), SU(2), SU(3))
- Why THREE generations of fermions
- Why THESE masses and coupling constants

These are further fine-tuning questions. LRT situates quantum structure; it does not derive the Standard Model.

---

## 9. Fine-Tuning Reconsidered

### 9.1 Three Levels of Fine-Tuning

| Level | What Is Tuned | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Constants** | Parameters within QM + GR | α, G, Λ, particle masses |
| **Structure** | The mathematical framework | Complex Hilbert space, Born rule, unitarity |
| **Logic** | 3FLL themselves | Identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle |

Standard fine-tuning discussions focus on Level 1. LRT reveals Level 2: the framework itself is fine-tuned.

Level 3 is not fine-tuned in the same sense - 3FLL are constitutive, not selected from alternatives. There is no space of "possible logics" from which classical logic was chosen. 3FLL are the condition for any structure at all.

### 9.2 The Depth of Structural Fine-Tuning

Consider the chain of dependencies:

1. Without 3FLL: no distinguishability, no structure
2. Without quantum structure: no stable atoms, no chemistry
3. Without fine-tuned constants: no stars, no planets, no life

Level 1 (constants) gets the attention. But Level 2 (structure) is more fundamental. You cannot tune constants if the framework does not support stable physics at all.

Quantum fine-tuning is the deepest level of contingency we can articulate - deeper than cosmic fine-tuning, because it concerns the framework within which cosmic parameters are defined.

### 9.3 Why This Matters

Fine-tuning is often framed as a puzzle requiring explanation (multiverse, design, etc.). LRT does not solve this puzzle. But it clarifies what the puzzle is.

The question is not just: why these constants?
The question is: why this structure?

LRT shows that quantum structure is required for stable physics. It does not explain why stable physics exists. But it situates the question correctly.

---

## 10. Wheeler Grounded

### 10.1 "It from Bit"

John Archibald Wheeler proposed that physical reality ("it") emerges from informational yes/no questions ("bit"). This was visionary but programmatic - Wheeler never fully grounded the proposal.

LRT provides the grounding:

**What is a bit?** The minimal unit of distinguishability, constituted by 3FLL.

**How do bits become "its"?** Through the interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. Possibilities in IIS become actual when 3FLL are enforced.

**Why quantum structure?** Because quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface - the only structure that produces physics capable of asking the question.

### 10.2 "Bit from Fit"

We extend Wheeler's slogan: **It from bit, bit from fit.**

- **It from bit:** Physical reality emerges from information
- **Bit from fit:** The bit (fundamental distinction) emerges from the fit between IIS and Boolean actuality

The "fit" is the fine-tuning. Quantum structure fits - it interfaces correctly between possibility and actuality while producing stable physics. Classical structure does not fit - it satisfies the interface constraints but does not produce stability. Other structures do not fit - they fail the interface constraints entirely.

"Fit" captures:
- The precision required (exact quantum structure)
- The selection criterion (stability)
- The relationship (interface between domains)

### 10.3 The Conversion Factor

If bits are fundamental and physics emerges from them, there must be a conversion between informational and physical quantities.

ℏ (Planck's constant) is the natural candidate:

$$\text{Action} = \hbar \times \text{Complexity}$$

ℏ is the quantum of action - the minimal amount of physical change. If it is also the conversion factor from bits to action, then:

- The Planck scale is where bit-structure becomes directly relevant
- The classical world emerges from coarse-graining over many bits
- The "weirdness" of QM is the friction between bit-structure and continuous appearance

This is speculative but coherent with the framework.

---

## 11. Completing the Landscape

LRT does not stand alone. It connects to, grounds, or completes several existing programs in foundations of physics.

### 11.1 Interpretations Grounded

**Copenhagen:** Copenhagen refused to say what the wave function "really is" - it is a tool for predicting outcomes. LRT provides what Copenhagen refused: the wave function is IIS structure, real but not actual until measurement.

**QBism:** QBism says quantum states are agent's beliefs. LRT grounds what those beliefs track: the structure of IIS. Beliefs are not arbitrary; they correspond to genuine features of possibility space.

**Relational QM:** Rovelli's relational interpretation says properties are relative to interactions. LRT explains why: context determines which partition of IIS interfaces with actuality. Different interactions probe different aspects of the IIS structure.

**Many-Worlds:** As discussed, LRT preserves MWI's insights (wave function realism, no collapse mechanism) while restoring single actuality.

### 11.2 Programs Completed

**Reconstruction theorems:** Hardy, Chiribella, and others have derived quantum structure from operational axioms (e.g., tomographic locality, continuous reversibility). LRT grounds these axioms: they are features required for stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality.

**Decoherence:** The decoherence program explains how interference terms vanish through environmental interaction. LRT explains what decoherence accomplishes: the transfer of phase information to the environment, enforcing local Boolean structure.

**Wheeler's program:** As discussed, LRT grounds "it from bit."

### 11.3 Principles Connected

**Landauer's principle:** Erasing one bit of information costs at least kT ln 2 of energy. In LRT terms: destroying a distinction has thermodynamic cost because distinctions are ontologically real.

**Holographic principle:** The entropy of a region is bounded by its surface area in Planck units. In LRT terms: distinguishability has a spatial density limit; there is a maximum number of bits per Planck area.

**Bekenstein bound:** A region of space has finite information capacity. LRT: actuality can only support finite distinguishability in finite regions.

**Zeilinger's foundational principle:** An elementary system carries exactly one bit of information. LRT: the bit is the fundamental unit; elementary systems are minimal carriers.

### 11.4 Mathematical Universe Refined

Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) claims that reality IS mathematical structure - all consistent mathematical structures exist and we inhabit one of them.

LRT refines this:
- Not all mathematical structures in IIS are actualized
- 3FLL + stability select which structures produce physics
- The relationship is constitutive (3FLL → structure) not compositional (structure = reality)

LRT is compatible with the spirit of MUH while being more specific about the selection mechanism.

## 12. Honest Accounting

We must be clear about what LRT establishes and what remains fine-tuned or assumed.

### 12.1 What Is Derived

| Claim | Status | Basis |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Actuality is Boolean | Derived | 3FLL require determinacy |
| Distinguishability is constituted by 3FLL | Derived | Definition/analysis |
| Distinguishability is pairwise/quadratic | Derived | Structural analysis |
| The bit is the fundamental unit | Derived | Minimal distinguishability |
| Born rule (given Hilbert space) | Derived | Gleason's theorem |
| Measurement is category transition | Derived | IIS/actuality framework |
| Entanglement is global constraint | Derived | 3FLL as constraint field |

### 12.2 What Is Fine-Tuned

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Complex Hilbert space | Fine-tuned | Unique stable structure; not logically necessary |
| Unitarity | Fine-tuned | Required for stability; not derived |
| Specific quantum fields | Fine-tuned | Which modes exist is contingent |
| Particle masses | Fine-tuned | Parameter-level tuning |
| Coupling constants | Fine-tuned | Parameter-level tuning |
| Spacetime dimension | Fine-tuned | Not addressed by LRT |

### 12.3 What Is Given

| Element | Status | Note |
|---------|--------|------|
| 3FLL | Primitive | Constitutive; not derived |
| IIS | Primitive | Co-constitutive with 3FLL |
| Parsimony | Motivated | Natural metric on IIS; not fully derived (see Section 4.3) |

### 12.4 What LRT Does Not Explain

- Why there is something rather than nothing
- Why 3FLL rather than some other logical structure
- Why THESE quantum fields, masses, constants
- The arrow of time
- Consciousness/observation (beyond functional role in measurement)
- Whether fine-tuning reflects design, selection, or brute fact

### 12.5 Open Problems for Future Work

Several questions remain open and constitute a research program:

1. **The physical criterion for interface transition:** When exactly does Boolean actuality get enforced? Is it decoherence, irreversible amplification, gravitational threshold, or something else? LRT is compatible with various answers but does not determine one.

2. **Relativistic formulation:** How does the IIS/actuality framework respect the causal structure of spacetime? Can it be extended to quantum field theory in curved spacetime?

3. **Full grounding of parsimony:** Is parsimony derivable from stability requirements, or is it a brute fact about actuality?

4. **The ℏ-bit connection:** Is the conjecture S = ℏC (action equals Planck constant times complexity) a deep identity or merely suggestive analogy?

5. **Derivation of specific fields:** Can the framework explain why THESE quantum fields (electron, quark, photon) rather than others?

LRT is a framework, not a theory of everything. It situates physics within logical structure without claiming to derive all physics from logic.

## 13. Conclusion

### 13.1 Summary

Logic Realism Theory, developed in the companion paper, establishes that the Three Fundamental Logical Laws are constitutive of physical reality. This paper has extended the framework to quantum mechanics.

The core insight is that quantum mechanics is the interface between possibility (IIS) and actuality (Boolean structure). This interface is not logically necessary - it is fine-tuned. But it is the unique stable interface: perturbations destroy physics.

This framework dissolves foundational puzzles:
- **Measurement** is category transition, not mysterious collapse
- **Entanglement** is global constraint satisfaction, not spooky action
- **Wave function** is IIS structure - real but not actual
- **Quantization** reflects Boolean grain of actuality
- **Identical particles** are excitations of the same distinguishability mode

The framework grounds Wheeler's "it from bit": the bit (fundamental distinction) derives from 3FLL; quantum mechanics is what bit-structure looks like interfacing with Boolean actuality.

### 13.2 The Title Explained

**It from bit:** Physical reality emerges from information - from yes/no questions, from distinctions, from bits.

**Bit from fit:** Those bits - those distinctions - arise from the fit between possibility and actuality. The fit is precise. The fit is fine-tuned. The fit is quantum mechanics.

### 13.3 Final Reflection

We have not explained why reality has the structure it does. We have not derived physics from pure logic. We have not solved the mystery of existence.

What we have done is situate the mystery correctly.

The question is not: why does physics obey logic? (It must - 3FLL are constitutive.)

The question is not: why does quantum mechanics have its specific structure? (This is fine-tuning.)

The question is: why does anything exist that requires logic to structure it at all?

LRT does not answer this question. But it shows what the question is, and that is not nothing.

The laws of logic are not merely how we think. Quantum mechanics is not merely how physics works. Together, they are the structure of actuality itself - the pattern in which existence is possible.

It from bit. Bit from fit. The fit survives. That is why we are here to ask.
