# Issue 010: IIS-LRT Paper - Obviating Many-Worlds

**Status**: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Priority**: HIGH

## Summary

Development of a paper presenting the Infinite Information Space (IIS) combined with Logic Realism Theory (LRT) as a framework for quantum foundations that obviates the Many-Worlds Interpretation through a three-stage ontological structure.

---

## Core Thesis

IIS-LRT proposes a three-stage ontological structure:
1. **REPRESENTABLE** (Stage 1): All formally specifiable information structures, including logically incoherent ones
2. **PERMISSIBLE** (Stage 2): Subset satisfying LOI/LNC/LEM - where quantum states and Born probabilities live
3. **ACTUAL** (Stage 3): Single outcome selected from Stage 2 per measurement

**Key Result**: MWI and IIS-LRT share Stages 1-2 but diverge at Stage 3. MWI actualizes all outcomes (branching); IIS-LRT actualizes one. Parsimony favors IIS-LRT.

## Paper Outline

### I. INTRODUCTION
- Measurement problem and interpretive landscape
- Logic as explanatory primitive (LRT summary)
- Thesis statement

### II. LOGIC REALISM THEORY: SUMMARY AND STATUS
- Core postulate: LOI, LNC, LEM as physical boundary conditions
- Ontic vs. epistemic constraints
- Falsification criterion and testability

### III. INFINITE INFORMATION SPACE AND THREE-STAGE FRAMEWORK
- Stage 1 (Representable): All formal structures including incoherent
- Stage 2 (Permissible): LRT-filtered, where physics lives
- Stage 3 (Actual): Single outcome selected
- Transition types:
  - Stage 1→2: STRUCTURAL (not processual)
  - Stage 2→3: DYNAMICAL (where probability operates)
- QM as dual-domain theory (operates in both Stage 1 and 2)
- Information-theoretic ontology (Wheeler's "it from bit")
- Formal characterization of IIS

### IV. SYNTHESIS: LRT AS CONSTRAINT ON IIS
- What IIS-LRT solves vs. leaves open
- Probability as opportunity structure ("opportunistic" model)
- LRT as structural boundary, not dynamical filter
- Where wavefunctions and superpositions live
- Born rule question: preliminary approaches
- Worked example: Spin-1/2 system

### V. OBVIATING MANY-WORLDS
- MWI's explanatory structure
- MWI vs. IIS-LRT in three-stage terms
- Parsimony argument
- Addressing MWI advantages (determinism, no collapse, elegance)

### VI. THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM REFRAMED
- Traditional framing vs. IIS-LRT reframing
- What IIS-LRT explains vs. relocates
- Decoherence and classical limit
- Distinguishing from "standard QM + classical logic"

### VII. IMPLICATIONS AND PREDICTIONS
- Empirical equivalence with standard QM
- Potential divergences (honest assessment)
- Philosophical implications

### VIII. OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES
- "Just Copenhagen with extra steps"
- "LRT is unfalsifiable"
- "IIS is too vague"
- "Haven't eliminated collapse"
- "MWI is more elegant"
- "Relocated measurement problem to actualization"
- "Why should logic be ontic?"

### IX. FUTURE WORK
- Mathematical formalization of IIS
- Born rule derivation
- Case studies (Bell tests, Kochen-Specker, quantum computation)
- Quantum gravity applications

### X. CONCLUSION
- Summary of framework
- Main result: MWI obviated
- The key move: elevation of logic from assumption to constraint

## Key Conceptual Innovations

### Three-Stage Structure
```
REPRESENTABLE (all formal structures)
    ↓ [structural: LRT defines boundary]
PERMISSIBLE (LRT-compliant; physics lives here; Born measure defined here)
    ↓ [dynamical: selection with probability]
ACTUAL (single outcome recorded)
```

### Transition Types
- **Stage 1→2**: STRUCTURAL - LRT defines boundary; not temporal; not a process
- **Stage 2→3**: DYNAMICAL - involves time, interaction, measurement; where Born probabilities apply

### Where Things Live
| Element | Stage |
|---------|-------|
| Wavefunctions | Stage 2 (already LRT-compliant) |
| Paraconsistent structures | Stage 1 only (not instantiable) |
| Born probabilities | Measure on Stage 2 |
| Superposition | Stage 2 property (multiple Stage 3 candidates) |

### What IIS-LRT Solves vs. Leaves Open

**SOLVES:**
- Why no contradictions in measurement records (LRT forbids at Stage 2)
- Why definite outcomes exist (only LRT-compliant states can be actualized)
- Where probabilities are meaningful (on permissible subspace)
- Why psychologism fails (Stage 1 shows we can represent what Stage 2 forbids)

**LEAVES OPEN:**
- Why THIS outcome rather than another (selection mechanism)
- Derivation of Born rule from deeper principles
- Whether selection is deterministic or stochastic
- Compatible with multiple interpretations

### The "Opportunistic" Probability Model

Traditional binary:
- Deterministic: probability is epistemic (ignorance)
- Stochastic: probability is ontic (irreducible chance)

IIS-LRT alternative:
- Stage 2: Born weights = objective structure of opportunities
- Stage 3: Actualization selects definitively from that structure
- Probability describes Stage 2; actuality describes Stage 3
- Neither reducible to the other

### MWI Comparison

| Aspect | MWI | IIS-LRT |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Stage 1 | (implicit) all math structures | All representable (IIS) |
| Stage 2 | Quantum states (Hilbert space) | LRT-permissible structures |
| Stage 3 | ALL outcomes actualize (branches) | ONE outcome actualizes |
| Parsimony | Ontological explosion | No multiplication of actuality |

## Key Distinctions from Standard QM + Classical Logic

**Standard QM + classical logic:**
- Logic presupposed as background assumption
- Not part of physical postulates
- No explanation of WHY outcomes respect logic

**IIS-LRT:**
- Logic IS a physical postulate
- LOI/LNC/LEM explicitly constrain admissible state spaces
- Falsifiable: macroscopic P∧¬P would refute
- Integrated with information ontology

**The key move**: ELEVATION of logical laws from background assumption to falsifiable physical constraint.

## QM as Dual-Domain Theory

QM operates in BOTH Stage 1 and Stage 2:

**Stage 2 (Physical):**
- Wavefunctions, Hilbert space, unitary evolution
- Born probabilities, measurement records
- Everything yielding empirical predictions

**Stage 1 (Representational):**
- Formalism represents superpositions interpretable as "P and not-P"
- Motivates logic-revision proposals
- Arena where interpretive debates occur

This explains why QM is the testing ground for logic:
- Mathematics lives partly in Stage 1 (resembling LNC violations)
- All actual outcomes live in Stage 2 (never violating LRT)

---

## Open Questions for Future Work

1. Mathematical formalization of IIS and LRT-permissible subspace
2. Derivation of Born rule from IIS-LRT structure
3. Relationship to specific interpretations (GRW, Bohmian, relational)
4. Application to quantum gravity (where Hilbert space may not apply)
5. Whether Stage 2→3 transition is fundamental or emergent (decoherence)
