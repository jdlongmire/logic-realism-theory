# ISSUE 018: Precision Tests of Conservation and Signaling (Falsification)

**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** HIGH (empirical confrontation)
**Phase:** 4 - Empirical Confrontation
**Created:** 2025-12-16

## 1. Summary

LRT predicts *exact* conservation laws and *zero* superluminal signaling as logical necessities. The theory must aggressively seek empirical challenges.

**The Gap:** LRT makes strong claims that distinguish it from theories allowing approximate conservation or signaling loopholes. These claims need confrontation with the highest-precision experimental data.

**Success Metric:** Survival of LRT predictions against the most stringent available tests, or identification of falsifying anomalies.

## 2. LRT Predictions to Test

### 2.1 Conservation Laws (Section 17 of core paper)

LRT claims conservation is **exact**, not merely approximately true:

| Conservation Law | LRT Prediction | Testable at |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Energy | Exact E conservation | High-energy physics |
| Momentum | Exact p conservation | Particle collisions |
| Angular momentum | Exact L conservation | Atomic/nuclear transitions |
| Charge | Exact Q conservation | Proton decay searches |

**Key difference from Standard Model:**
- SM: Conservation is observed but could have exceptions
- LRT: Conservation is logically necessary (no exceptions possible)

### 2.2 No-Signaling (Section 18 of core paper)

LRT claims superluminal signaling is **impossible**, not just practically difficult:

| Claim | LRT Prediction | Test Type |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Tsirelson bound | S ≤ 2√2 exact | Bell test experiments |
| No-signaling | Zero correlations above bound | Loophole-free Bell tests |
| Frame-independence | Same results in all frames | Relativistic quantum experiments |

## 3. Critical Experiments

### 3.1 Energy Conservation Tests

**Best current data:**
- Neutrino mass experiments (keV precision)
- Cosmic ray energy spectra
- Black hole thermodynamics

**What would falsify LRT:**
- Any energy non-conservation, even at Planck-suppressed levels
- "Energy anomalies" in extreme gravitational fields
- Perpetual motion devices (obviously)

### 3.2 Proton Decay Searches

**Current limits:** τ_proton > 10³⁴ years (Super-Kamiokande)

**LRT prediction:** Proton decay is impossible if it violates conservation
- Note: Some GUT proton decay modes conserve B-L
- LRT must specify which conservation is fundamental

### 3.3 Bell Test Experiments

**Best current data:**
- Loophole-free Bell tests (Delft 2015, Vienna 2015, NIST 2015)
- S = 2.42 ± 0.02 (within Tsirelson bound 2√2 ≈ 2.83)
- No superluminal correlations detected

**What would falsify LRT:**
- S > 2√2 (violates Tsirelson bound)
- Any superluminal signaling detected
- Frame-dependent Bell violations

### 3.4 Gravitational Tests

**Extreme regime tests:**
- Black hole mergers (LIGO/Virgo)
- Pulsar timing arrays
- Cosmological observations

**What would falsify LRT:**
- Energy non-conservation in mergers
- Violation of no-signaling in gravitational wave propagation

## 4. Data Review Protocol

### 4.1 Sources to Review

| Domain | Key Data | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Particle physics | PDG compilation | To review |
| Cosmology | Planck data | To review |
| Gravitational waves | LIGO/Virgo catalogs | To review |
| Bell tests | 2015-2024 experiments | To review |
| Proton decay | Super-K, Hyper-K | To review |

### 4.2 What to Look For

1. **Anomalies** - any reported violations of conservation
2. **Tensions** - any discrepancies between observations and predictions
3. **Loopholes** - any experimental gaps that LRT predictions rely on
4. **Precision limits** - current best bounds on violations

### 4.3 Honest Assessment

For each experiment:
- Does LRT make a distinct prediction?
- Is the prediction testable with current precision?
- Has the test been done?
- What was the result?

## 5. Falsification Criteria

### 5.1 Strong Falsifiers (from Appendix B of core paper)

| Falsifier | What it would show |
|-----------|-------------------|
| S > 2√2 | LRT wrong about Tsirelson bound |
| Non-Boolean logic in nature | LRT wrong about 3FLL ontology |
| Superluminal signaling | LRT wrong about no-signaling |
| Energy non-conservation | LRT wrong about conservation derivation |

### 5.2 Weak Falsifiers

| Observation | What it might show |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Proton decay | LRT must clarify which conservation is fundamental |
| Dark energy | LRT must explain apparent non-conservation at cosmic scales |
| Measurement anomalies | LRT must sharpen measurement predictions |

## 6. Current Experimental Status

### 6.1 Conservation Tests

| Test | Current Limit | LRT Status |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Charge conservation | q_e stable to 10⁻²² | Consistent |
| Baryon number | τ_p > 10³⁴ y | Consistent |
| Energy (local) | No violations | Consistent |
| Energy (global) | Dark energy? | Open question |

### 6.2 No-Signaling Tests

| Test | Current Result | LRT Status |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Bell inequality | S = 2.42 ± 0.02 < 2√2 | Consistent |
| Loophole closure | All major loopholes closed | Consistent |
| Frame independence | No violations | Consistent |
