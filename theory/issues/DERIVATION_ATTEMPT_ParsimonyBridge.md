# Derivation Attempt: Axiom 3 via Parsimony Bridge

**Issue**: ISSUE 001
**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Source**: GPT synthesis proposal (Interaction 7)

## The Proposal

GPT claims that **Parsimony** (Theorem 16.10) can serve as the bridge between logical time and Axiom 3 constraints. The argument:

> "Parsimony is the natural constraint that turns 'logical time' into 'continuous reversible locally compositional time,' and *that* turns Axiom 3 from a brute physical postulate into a logical-metaphysical necessity."

---

## Key LRT Results We're Building On

**Theorem 16.10 (Global Parsimony)**: Actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions and nothing more.

**Truthmaker Non-Surplus Principle (TNSP)**: If a proposition P has Boolean value v, then some ground G determines P = v. No surplus propositions exist in actuality.

**Constitutive Closure Principle (CCP)**: If domain D is constituted by package P_const, then D contains exactly the structure generated by P_const.

## Derivation Attempt 1: Parsimony ⇒ Continuity

### GPT's Argument

> "Discontinuous dynamics require needless structure, needless exceptions, and arbitrary truthmaker commitments."
>
> "Discontinuous update rules, jump dynamics, piecewise rules, or rules requiring exception tables all violate the Minimal Truthmaker Principle."

### Formalization Attempt

**Definition**: Let the *specification complexity* of dynamics T be the minimal information required to specify T.

**Claim**: Continuous dynamics have lower specification complexity than discontinuous dynamics (on average).

**Analysis**:

This claim is not obviously true in general. Consider:
- f(x) = 0 for x < 0, f(x) = 1 for x ≥ 0 (discontinuous, simple specification)
- f(x) = sin(1/x) * exp(-x²) * ... (continuous, complex specification)

However, there's a better version:

**Refined Claim**: Among dynamics that preserve IIS structure (as required), continuous dynamics are the simplest *class*.

**Why?**
1. IIS has a metric structure induced by distinguishability D
2. Dynamics must be automorphisms of this structure (from reversibility argument)
3. The automorphism groups of metric spaces are naturally Lie groups
4. Lie groups have continuous action by definition
5. Discontinuous automorphisms would require specifying "where the jumps are"
6. This adds specification complexity beyond the group structure itself

**Problem**: This argument uses reversibility (automorphism structure) to derive continuity. But we want to derive both from parsimony.

### Alternative: Temporal Smoothness from Truthmaker Minimality

**Argument**:
1. Logical time = ordering of IIS→Boolean resolutions
2. Each resolution creates a truthmaker for a Boolean proposition
3. If dynamics are discontinuous, a small change in IIS state produces a large change in which resolutions occur
4. This means: the truthmaker for "system is at state s₂" must encode "we jumped from s₁"
5. Such jump-encoding is surplus structure - it's not grounded in the IIS state itself
6. By TNSP, surplus structure is forbidden
7. Therefore: dynamics must be continuous (no jumps to encode)

**Critical Analysis of Step 4-5**:

Does a discontinuous jump really create "surplus structure"?

If T is discontinuous at s₁ (small perturbation → large change in output), then:
- The truthmaker for "system is at T(s₁)" is just the state T(s₁)
- It doesn't need to "remember" where it came from
- The discontinuity is in the *map*, not in the *resulting state*

**Counter-argument**:
But the *dynamics* must be specified as part of the theory. If dynamics are discontinuous, the specification includes exception points. These exception points are surplus structure not generated by 3FLL + distinguishability.

**This is better**: The argument is that discontinuous dynamics require extra specification beyond what 3FLL + distinguishability + IIS generate.

### Verdict on Parsimony ⇒ Continuity

**PLAUSIBLE BUT NEEDS PRECISION**

The argument works if we accept:
- "Specification complexity of dynamics" is a well-defined notion
- Parsimony applies to theoretical specification, not just actuality content
- Continuous dynamics minimize specification complexity for structure-preserving maps

This is not a pure logical derivation, but it's a genuine *parsimony argument* - which is what GPT claimed.

**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS - parsimony motivates continuity, though the formalization needs work.

## Derivation Attempt 2: Parsimony ⇒ Reversibility

### GPT's Argument

> "Irreversible fundamental dynamics require: extra primitives (e.g., noise operators), extra truthmakers, extra informational structure, extra distinctions that cannot be grounded in IIS, asymmetrical update rules baked into ontology."

### Formalization Attempt

**Claim**: Irreversible dynamics require more specification than reversible dynamics.

**Analysis**:

For reversible dynamics T:
- T is a bijection (one-to-one and onto)
- Can be specified by a group action
- Time-reversal is "free" (T⁻¹ exists by construction)

For irreversible dynamics T:
- T is not injective (multiple states map to one) OR not surjective (some states unreachable)
- Cannot be specified by a group action alone
- Requires specifying: which states merge, or which states are forbidden
- This is additional structure beyond group specification

**This seems right**: Reversible dynamics have more symmetry (time-reversal), and symmetry is a form of parsimony.

### Connection to Truthmakers

**Argument**:
1. In IIS, states are individuated by distinguishability
2. If dynamics T merges states (T(x) = T(y) for x ≠ y), then the distinction between x and y is lost
3. This distinction was grounded in 3FLL + distinguishability structure
4. Losing a grounded distinction requires a *mechanism* for losing it
5. That mechanism is extra structure not in the constitutive package
6. By CCP, the constitutive package generates exactly what's in the domain
7. Therefore: no mechanism for losing distinctions exists in fundamental dynamics
8. Therefore: dynamics preserve distinctions = reversible

**Critical Analysis**:

This is actually close to our earlier argument (Attempt 1 in DERIVATION_ATTEMPT_Continuity_Reversibility.md), but now grounded in parsimony:

- Before: "Dynamics should preserve structure" (assumed)
- Now: "Dynamics cannot destroy structure because the destruction mechanism would be surplus"

**The key move**: The *mechanism* for irreversibility (noise, dissipation, coarse-graining) requires specification. This specification is not generated by the constitutive package (3FLL + s₀). Therefore it's surplus. Therefore it doesn't exist at the fundamental level.

### Verdict on Parsimony ⇒ Reversibility

**SUCCESS** (with appropriate framing)

The argument works:
1. Irreversible dynamics require a specification for *how* information is lost
2. This specification is not generated by (3FLL + s₀)
3. By CCP + Parsimony, non-generated specification doesn't exist
4. Therefore fundamental dynamics are reversible

This is genuinely better than our previous "structure preservation" argument because parsimony is already proven (Theorem 16.10), not assumed.

**Status**: SUCCESS - reversibility follows from parsimony applied to dynamics specification.

## Derivation Attempt 3: Parsimony ⇒ Local Tomography

### GPT's Argument

> "Why not allow irreducibly global degrees of freedom? Because: irreducibly global state variables add surplus structure, they increase model complexity, they violate the truthmaker minimality constraint, they introduce hidden structure that never cashes out in Boolean interface outcomes."

### Formalization Attempt

**Definition**: A composite system AB has *irreducibly global structure* if its state ψ_AB contains information not determined by:
- State of A (ρ_A)
- State of B (ρ_B)
- Correlations between A and B (expressible in local terms)

**Local Tomography says**: No irreducibly global structure exists. ψ_AB is determined by local measurement statistics.

**Parsimony Argument**:

1. Suppose ψ_AB has irreducibly global component G
2. G is not determinable by any local measurement on A or B
3. G never produces any Boolean outcome at the interface (local measurements can't access it)
4. By TNSP, propositions must have grounds that determine Boolean values
5. "G has value g" is a proposition with no Boolean cash-out
6. Therefore "G has value g" is not a grounded proposition
7. By Parsimony (Theorem 16.10), ungrounded propositions don't exist in actuality
8. Therefore G doesn't exist
9. Therefore no irreducibly global structure exists
10. Therefore local tomography holds

**Critical Analysis**:

**Step 3 is the key claim**: Does irreducibly global structure *never* produce Boolean outcomes?

**Potential problem**: What if G affects the *probabilities* of local outcomes without being directly measurable?

In standard QM, entanglement affects probabilities of joint outcomes (correlations). But entanglement IS accessible through local measurements + classical communication (tomography). So entanglement is not "irreducibly global" in this sense.

**What would genuinely irreducibly global structure look like?**

It would be structure that:
- Affects no local measurement statistics
- Affects no joint measurement statistics
- Is completely inaccessible to the interface

Such structure is indeed "surplus" by TNSP - it has no Boolean cash-out.

**But**: What if the irreducibly global structure affects joint measurements (not local)?

Then it DOES have Boolean cash-out (joint measurement outcomes).

So the question becomes: is joint measurement "local" or "global"?

**Key insight**: Local tomography doesn't forbid joint measurements. It says the *state* is determined by local statistics. Joint measurement statistics are computed from the state, which is locally determined.

If there were structure that only showed up in joint measurements and couldn't be reconstructed from local statistics, that would violate local tomography.

**Parsimony argument revised**:

1. Consider hypothetical structure G that requires joint-only measurement
2. The interface produces Boolean outcomes for both local and joint measurements
3. If G only affects joint measurements, the joint outcomes have truthmakers involving G
4. But joint measurements are performed on subsystems that exist locally
5. The truthmaker for joint outcomes should be decomposable into local truthmakers + their coupling
6. G introduces a truthmaker that is not decomposable this way
7. This non-decomposable truthmaker is extra structure beyond local truthmakers + coupling
8. By parsimony, extra structure is forbidden
9. Therefore G doesn't exist
10. Therefore local tomography

**Critical Analysis of Step 5-7**:

This assumes that joint measurement truthmakers "should be" decomposable. But why?

**Response**: Because the measurement apparatus for AB is built from apparatuses for A and B (physically). The truthmaker for "apparatus registered outcome" should be decomposable into apparatus components.

**But this is a physical assumption** about how measurements work, not a logical necessity.

### Alternative: From Interface Locality

**Argument**:
1. The interface Φ maps IIS → Boolean
2. Φ is constituted by (3FLL + distinguishability structure)
3. Distinguishability is pairwise (Axiom 2) - it compares two states
4. For composite systems, pairwise comparison can be decomposed: D(ψ_AB, φ_AB) involves comparing subsystem structures
5. The interface must respect this pairwise/compositional structure
6. Therefore Φ produces outcomes determinable from local comparisons
7. Therefore local tomography

**Problem with Step 4**: Pairwise comparison of composite states doesn't automatically decompose into local comparisons. That's exactly what local tomography claims.

### Verdict on Parsimony ⇒ Local Tomography

**IMPROVED BUT NOT FULLY DERIVED**

The parsimony argument is better than previous attempts:
- Irreducibly global structure with no Boolean cash-out is genuinely surplus
- Parsimony forbids such surplus

But the argument has a gap:
- What about global structure that DOES have Boolean cash-out through joint measurements?
- The decomposability of joint truthmakers is asserted, not derived

**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS - parsimony eliminates some types of non-local structure, but the full derivation of local tomography still has gaps.

## Summary: The Parsimony Bridge

| Constraint | Parsimony Argument | Status |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Continuity | Discontinuous dynamics require surplus specification (exception points) | PLAUSIBLE - needs formalization |
| Reversibility | Irreversibility mechanisms are surplus structure not in constitutive package | SUCCESS |
| Local Tomography | Irreducibly global structure with no Boolean cash-out is surplus | PARTIAL - decomposability gap remains |

### Key Achievement

**Reversibility is now genuinely derived** from parsimony:
- The mechanism for information loss is not generated by (3FLL + s₀)
- By CCP + Parsimony, it doesn't exist at fundamental level
- Therefore fundamental dynamics preserve information = reversible

This is a real improvement over our previous "conditional" status.

### Remaining Gaps

**Continuity**: The argument is intuitive but "specification complexity" needs rigorous definition.

**Local Tomography**: The decomposability of joint measurement truthmakers is assumed, not derived. This might be the irreducible physical content of local tomography.

---

## Recommendation

**Integrate parsimony bridge into manuscript** with honest accounting:

1. **Reversibility**: Upgrade from "conditionally derived" to "derived from parsimony"
2. **Continuity**: Present parsimony argument with acknowledgment that formalization is ongoing
3. **Local Tomography**: Present parsimony argument but acknowledge decomposability assumption

This significantly strengthens the grounding while maintaining honesty about remaining gaps.

## The New Derivation Chain

```
3FLL (Axiom 1)
  ⇒ Distinguishability (constituted)
  ⇒ IIS Structure (Definition 16.3)
  ⇒ Boolean Actuality (Axiom 4)
  ⇒ Truthmaker Non-Surplus Principle
  ⇒ Parsimony (Theorem 16.10) ← PROVEN

Parsimony + IIS Structure:
  ⇒ Reversibility (no mechanism for info loss) ← DERIVED
  ⇒ Continuity (minimal dynamics specification) ← MOTIVATED
  ⇒ Local Tomography (no inaccessible global structure) ← PARTIAL

Axiom 3 (now partially grounded) + remaining physical content:
  ⇒ Hilbert Space (Masanes-Müller)
  ⇒ Born Rule (Gleason)
  ⇒ QM Structure
```

## Next Steps

1. Update Section 16.8 with parsimony bridge argument
2. Upgrade reversibility status to "derived"
3. Add parsimony-based arguments for continuity and local tomography
4. Acknowledge remaining gaps honestly
5. Consider new section on "Logical Time and Parsimony"
