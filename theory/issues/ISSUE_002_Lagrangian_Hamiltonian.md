# ISSUE 002: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulations

## Problem Statement

LRT derives quantum mechanics from logical foundations via reconstruction theorems (Masanes-Müller, Gleason). However, the connection to classical mechanics formulations - specifically Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics - has not been explicitly developed.

**Key questions**:
1. Can the action principle (Lagrangian formulation) be grounded in LRT?
2. Does the symplectic structure (Hamiltonian formulation) emerge from IIS structure?
3. How does the classical limit arise from LRT's framework?
4. What is the relationship between LRT's "logical time" and the time parameter in L and H?

## Relevance to LRT

### Connection to Existing Work

- **Section 21.1**: Action-Complexity Conjecture (S = ℏC) suggests action has information-theoretic meaning
- **Layer Structure**: Layer 1 (IIS Dynamics) should connect to Hamiltonian evolution
- **Reversibility**: Now derived from parsimony - connects to symplectic structure preservation

### Potential Grounding Paths

1. **Hamiltonian from IIS**:
   - IIS has metric structure from distinguishability
   - Symplectic structure may emerge from this metric + dynamics
   - Hamiltonian = generator of time evolution on IIS

2. **Lagrangian from Path Integral**:
   - Path integral formulation uses action S = ∫L dt
   - LRT's logical time may ground the integral measure
   - Stationary action ↔ most parsimonious path?

3. **Classical Limit**:
   - ℏ → 0 limit of quantum mechanics
   - LRT perspective: interface resolution becomes sharp
   - Boolean actuality dominates IIS structure

## Specific Sub-Issues

### ISSUE 002a: Symplectic Structure from IIS

**Question**: Does the symplectic form ω on phase space emerge from IIS distinguishability structure?

**Leads**:
- Kähler structure on projective Hilbert space
- Information geometry (Fisher-Rao metric)
- Fubini-Study metric and its symplectic form

### ISSUE 002b: Action Principle Grounding

**Question**: Can the principle of stationary action be derived or motivated from LRT axioms?

**Leads**:
- Feynman path integral: sum over histories
- LRT interpretation: sum over IIS paths?
- Parsimony: stationary action = minimal specification?

### ISSUE 002c: Time Parameter

**Question**: How does the time parameter t in L(q, q̇, t) and H(q, p, t) relate to LRT's logical time?

**Leads**:
- Logical time = ordering of Boolean resolutions
- Parameter time = continuous approximation?
- Schrödinger equation: iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ

### ISSUE 002d: Classical-Quantum Correspondence

**Question**: How does LRT explain the emergence of classical mechanics from quantum?

**Leads**:
- Decoherence and einselection
- Layer 3 (Interface Approach) dynamics
- Boolean actuality as classical limit

## Success Criteria

A successful treatment would:

1. **Derive or motivate** the symplectic structure from IIS
2. **Ground** the action principle in LRT's framework
3. **Explain** the time parameter in terms of logical time
4. **Show** how classical mechanics emerges in appropriate limits
5. **Connect** to the Action-Complexity conjecture (Section 21.1)

## Notes

This issue is lower priority than ISSUE 001 (Axiom 3 grounding) but important for:
- Completeness of LRT as a foundations program
- Connection to established physics formalism
- Potential new insights from LRT perspective on classical mechanics
