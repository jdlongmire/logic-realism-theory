# Circularity Check: Axiom 3 Derivations via Parsimony

**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Purpose**: Verify non-circularity of the parsimony bridge arguments

---

## 1. The Dependency Chain We're Checking

```
Claimed derivation:
  Theorem 16.10 (Parsimony) → Reversibility (Axiom 3b)

We need to verify:
  Theorem 16.10 does NOT depend on Axiom 3
```

---

## 2. What Does Parsimony (Theorem 16.10) Depend On?

### Direct Dependencies

| Element | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Axiom 1 | Axiom | 3FLL constitute distinguishability |
| Axiom 4 | Axiom | Boolean actuality exists (3FLL enforcement domain) |
| CCP | Principle | Constitutive Closure - domain contains only what constitutive package generates |
| TM | Principle | Truthmaker Requirement - Boolean values need grounds |
| Definition 16.6 | Definition | Grounded proposition - sources (1)-(4) |

### Critical Examination of Definition 16.6

**Definition 16.6 (Grounded Proposition)**: P is grounded iff its truth-value is determined by:
1. Logical necessity from 3FLL
2. Logical entailment from grounded propositions
3. Initial condition s₀
4. **Propagation through dynamical laws** ← POTENTIAL ISSUE

**Question**: Does source (4) "dynamical laws" already presuppose Axiom 3 properties?

---

## 3. Circularity Analysis: Reversibility Derivation

### The Argument (from DERIVATION_ATTEMPT_ParsimonyBridge.md)

1. Irreversible dynamics require a mechanism for information loss
2. This mechanism requires specification beyond (3FLL + s₀)
3. By CCP + Parsimony: surplus specification doesn't exist
4. Therefore: no mechanism for information loss
5. Therefore: reversibility

### Potential Circularity #1: Scope of Parsimony

**Issue**: Theorem 16.10 says "Actuality contains exactly grounded propositions."

But IIS dynamics are NOT in actuality - they're the pre-Boolean structure!

**Question**: Does parsimony about actuality constrain IIS structure?

**Analysis**:
- Parsimony is about BOOLEAN ACTUALITY (what propositions exist with truth values)
- IIS dynamics are about TRANSFORMATIONS on IIS (pre-Boolean)
- These are different domains!

**Verdict**: ⚠️ POTENTIAL GAP - Parsimony applies to actuality, not directly to IIS dynamics.

### Potential Circularity #2: Definition 16.6 Source (4)

**Issue**: "Propagation through dynamical laws" is a grounding source.

If we use this to prove parsimony, then use parsimony to constrain dynamics, is that circular?

**Analysis**:
- Definition 16.6 says dynamics CAN ground propositions
- It doesn't say WHAT dynamics exist
- The parsimony argument is about what MECHANISMS exist, not what propositions are grounded

**Verdict**: ✅ NOT CIRCULAR - Definition 16.6 doesn't presuppose dynamics properties.

### Potential Circularity #3: CCP Applied to IIS

**Alternative formulation**: Apply CCP directly to IIS, not via Parsimony.

**Argument**:
1. IIS is constituted by (3FLL + distinguishability)
2. By CCP: IIS contains exactly what this package generates
3. Reversible transformations (automorphisms) are generated by the structure
4. Irreversible transformations (non-automorphisms) require additional specification
5. By CCP: additional specification doesn't exist
6. Therefore: only automorphisms exist = reversibility

**Analysis**:
- Does CCP apply to IIS?
- CCP says: "If domain D is constituted by package P_const, then D contains only what P_const generates"
- Is IIS "constituted by" (3FLL + distinguishability)?
- Axiom 1: 3FLL constitute distinguishability ✓
- Definition 16.3: IIS is maximal closure under distinguishability

**Issue**: IIS is defined as MAXIMAL CLOSURE, which is different from direct constitution.

**Verdict**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN - Whether CCP applies to IIS needs clarification.

---

## 4. Circularity Analysis: Continuity Derivation

### The Argument

1. Discontinuous dynamics require "exception points" (where jumps occur)
2. Exception points are surplus specification
3. By parsimony: surplus doesn't exist
4. Therefore: continuity

### Analysis

Same scope issue as reversibility: parsimony is about actuality, not IIS dynamics.

Additionally: "exception points" in IIS dynamics are not propositions in actuality.

**Verdict**: ⚠️ SAME GAP as reversibility.

---

## 5. Circularity Analysis: Local Tomography Derivation

### The Argument

1. Suppose composite state has irreducibly global component G
2. G has no Boolean cash-out (not accessible to local measurements)
3. "G has value g" is a proposition with no truthmaker in actuality
4. By TNSP + Parsimony: such propositions don't exist
5. Therefore: G doesn't exist
6. Therefore: local tomography

### Analysis

This argument IS about actuality:
- "G has value g" is a proposition
- The question is whether it has Boolean value
- If it has no Boolean cash-out, it's surplus
- Parsimony eliminates surplus propositions

**But**: The argument assumes G "has no Boolean cash-out." What if G affects joint measurement probabilities (which DO have Boolean cash-out)?

Then G DOES contribute to grounded propositions, so isn't surplus.

The real question: is there global structure that affects only JOINT measurements and cannot be reconstructed from local statistics?

If such structure exists, it's NOT surplus (it grounds joint outcomes).
Local tomography says: no such structure exists.
But we haven't DERIVED that from parsimony - we've just asserted it.

**Verdict**: ⚠️ GAP - The decomposability assumption is not derived from parsimony.

## 6. Summary of Circularity Check

| Derivation | Circular? | Main Issue |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Reversibility | NO (but has gap) | Parsimony is about actuality, not IIS dynamics |
| Continuity | NO (but has gap) | Same as reversibility |
| Local Tomography | NO (but has gap) | Decomposability assumption not derived |

### The Core Issue

**Parsimony (Theorem 16.10) is about Boolean actuality.**

**Axiom 3 constraints are about IIS structure and dynamics.**

**The gap**: We need a principle that connects parsimony-about-actuality to constraints-on-IIS.

---

## 7. Possible Fixes

### Option A: Extend CCP to IIS

Explicitly state that CCP applies to IIS:

> **CCP for IIS**: IIS contains exactly the structure generated by (3FLL + distinguishability closure).

This would make the reversibility argument direct (no detour through actuality).

**Issue**: Is this defensible? IIS is defined as maximal closure, not as constituted.

### Option B: Interface Constraint Principle

Add a principle connecting actuality parsimony to IIS structure:

> **Interface Constraint Principle (ICP)**: Structure in IIS that has no manifestation in Boolean actuality does not exist.

This would bridge the gap.

**Issue**: This is essentially assuming what we want to prove (that IIS structure is constrained by actuality requirements).

### Option C: Reframe the Argument

Instead of "parsimony forces reversibility," say:

> **Minimal Dynamics Principle**: Among dynamics compatible with IIS structure, the minimal specification is reversible (automorphisms).

This is honest about what we're claiming: reversibility is the MINIMAL dynamics, not the ONLY logically possible dynamics.

**Issue**: This is a parsimony argument, but it's about theoretical simplicity, not about what exists.

### Option D: Accept the Gap

Be honest that:
- Parsimony about actuality doesn't STRICTLY constrain IIS dynamics
- The argument is a MOTIVATED inference, not a strict derivation
- Reversibility is the most parsimonious dynamics, but this is a meta-theoretical preference

---

## 8. Recommended Position

**The derivations are NOT circular** - they don't assume Axiom 3 to prove Axiom 3.

**But they have a scope gap** - Parsimony (Theorem 16.10) is about actuality, while Axiom 3 is about IIS dynamics.

**Honest framing**:

> "Parsimony about actuality *motivates* constraints on IIS dynamics. If IIS dynamics include mechanisms not reflected in Boolean actuality (surplus mechanisms), parsimony suggests they don't exist. This argument is not strictly deductive but follows the spirit of truthmaker minimalism: don't posit structure without grounding."

**Reversibility is still BETTER GROUNDED than before**:
- Before: Assumed "structure preservation" principle
- After: Derived from parsimony spirit applied to dynamics specification

**But we should not claim STRICT DERIVATION** unless we add an explicit principle connecting actuality parsimony to IIS constraints.

## 9. Action Items

1. ☐ Add explicit acknowledgment of scope gap in Section 16.8
2. ☐ Consider adding Interface Constraint Principle (Option B)
3. ☐ Reframe reversibility as "most parsimonious dynamics" rather than "derived"
4. ☐ Update ISSUE_001 with circularity check results
