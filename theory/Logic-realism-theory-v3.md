## Abstract

We present Logic Realism Theory (LRT), a framework in which quantum mechanics emerges from information-theoretic constraints imposed by three fundamental logical laws: identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle (3FLL). Formalized as **$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$**—where $\mathcal{A}$ represents physical actualization, $\mathfrak{L}$ the logical constraints, and $\mathcal{I}$ an infinite information space—LRT derives quantum phenomena that standard quantum mechanics postulates. The theory predicts that superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than classical states due to Excluded Middle coupling, yielding a testable signature: **T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9** (vs. ~1.0 in conventional quantum mechanics). This prediction is derived from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, making it falsifiable on current quantum hardware across superconducting, trapped-ion, and topological platforms. We present the mathematical framework, key derivations (Born rule, Hilbert space structure, time evolution), hierarchical emergence mechanism (logic → proto-mathematics → mathematics → physics), and formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant (~1,500 lines, 0 axioms in core proofs). Experimental protocols demonstrate >95% statistical power with 150 hours per quantum backend. Additional predictions include state-dependent Hamiltonian shifts and entropy-conditioned scaling in quantum error correction.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem: Can We Derive Quantum Mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is among the most successful theories in physics, yet its foundational postulates remain unexplained. The Born rule, Hilbert space structure, unitary evolution, and measurement collapse are introduced as axioms rather than derived from deeper principles (Dirac 1930; von Neumann 1932). This raises fundamental questions: *Why* does quantum mechanics take this particular mathematical form? *Why* do superposition and entanglement govern microscopic physics? Could these phenomena emerge from more fundamental constraints?

Recent efforts to derive quantum mechanics from information-theoretic principles (Hardy 2001; Chiribella et al. 2011; Höhn 2017) demonstrate progress but typically introduce new axioms—purification, reversibility, or specific operational postulates—leaving the question of ultimate foundations unresolved. Wheeler's "it from bit" program (Wheeler 1990) suggested that information might be more fundamental than spacetime, but did not provide a mechanism for how bits become its.

### 1.2 The Proposal: Logic as Bootstrap Constraint

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes a radical simplification: physical reality emerges from logical coherence requirements on an infinite information space. The three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL)—identity (A = A), non-contradiction (¬(A ∧ ¬A)), and excluded middle (A ∨ ¬A)—operate as ontological constraints that filter infinite possibility into finite actuality. These laws are not human constructs but pre-mathematical, pre-physical features of reality that operated before humans evolved and would continue operating if humans disappeared.

The core formalism is deceptively simple:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

where:
- **$\mathcal{I}$**: Infinite information space containing all logically possible configurations
- **$\mathfrak{L}$**: Filtering operator composed of the 3FLL
- **$\mathcal{A}$**: Physical actualization—the subset of $\mathcal{I}$ that manifests as observable reality

**Notation**: We use calligraphic typeface ($\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{I}$) for actualization and information space, and Fraktur typeface ($\mathfrak{L}$) for the logical filtering operator to distinguish from conventional physics notation (e.g., $\mathcal{L}$ for Lagrangian).

This is not merely a metaphor. LRT provides explicit mathematical mappings showing how quantum mechanics emerges from $\mathfrak{L}$'s action on $\mathcal{I}$ through a hierarchical process: logical constraints → proto-mathematical primitives → mathematical structures → physical laws. Crucially, geometry and arithmetic co-emerge at the mathematical layer; neither is privileged or presupposed.

### 1.3 Key Result: A Testable Prediction

Unlike purely philosophical approaches, LRT makes quantitative predictions about quantum systems. The Excluded Middle constraint, which forces binary resolution during measurement, couples to quantum superposition states. This coupling produces an additional decoherence channel beyond environmental effects. Our central prediction:

**Superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than would be expected from amplitude damping (T1 relaxation) alone.**

Quantitatively, the ratio of coherence time T2 (dephasing) to relaxation time T1 (amplitude damping) is:

**T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9**

This contrasts with conventional quantum mechanics, which predicts T2/T1 ≈ 1.0 for intrinsic decoherence in the absence of environmental noise. The deviation arises from Excluded Middle imposing entropy production proportional to Shannon entropy of superposition: ΔS_EM = ln(2) for equal superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩.

This prediction is:
- **Falsifiable**: Values consistently near 1.0 would invalidate LRT
- **Universal**: Independent of qubit implementation (superconducting, ion trap, topological)
- **Observable**: Testable with current quantum hardware using ~150 hours per backend
- **First-principles**: Derived from Fisher information geometry, not fitted to data

We have validated the experimental protocol via QuTiP simulation (>95% statistical power, ±2.8% error budget) and comprehensive confound analysis. The prediction awaits hardware testing.

### 1.4 Roadmap

This paper proceeds as follows:

**Section 2** presents the core thesis $\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$, including the necessity of the 3FLL, the nature of information space $\mathcal{I}$, and the human mind-independence of logical constraints.

**Section 3** introduces the hierarchical emergence framework, showing how proto-mathematical primitives (distinction, membership, relation, succession) emerge from the 3FLL, enabling mathematics to crystallize, which then provides infrastructure for physical laws. This resolves the "geometry vs. logic priority" question: they co-emerge.

**Section 4** provides mathematical formalization, including the Hilbert space model (epistemic tool, not ontology), constraint operator algebra, and the K-threshold framework distinguishing unitary (fixed K) from non-unitary (measurement, K → K-ΔK) regimes.

**Section 5** demonstrates that quantum mechanics emerges from LRT: Born rule from maximum entropy + non-contradiction, Hilbert space structure from information geometry, time evolution from identity constraint, and measurement as K-transition. We present a comparison table showing what LRT derives versus what QM postulates.

**Section 6** derives the T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 prediction from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, addressing the phenomenological parameter critique from peer review. We present confound isolation strategies and experimental protocols.

**Section 7** documents formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant: ~1,500 lines of verified code with 0 axioms in core derivations (3FLL proven from classical logic, not axiomatized). Key theorems include time emergence from identity, energy from Noether's theorem, and Russell's paradox filtering by non-contradiction.

**Section 8** provides comparative analysis distinguishing LRT from Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, pancomputationalism, and logical-structural realism, emphasizing discriminating predictions.

**Section 9** discusses objections, open questions, and future research directions.

**Section 10** concludes.

LRT offers a testable paradigm for quantum foundations that derives rather than postulates the core structure of quantum mechanics. The framework is falsifiable, computationally validated, and formally verified. Whether nature confirms our prediction that T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 will determine if logic truly constrains reality at the quantum scale.

## 2. Core Thesis: Bootstrap Ontology

### 2.1 The Necessity Argument

Consider an infinite information space containing all logically possible states—including contradictory configurations, incoherent superpositions, and physically impossible arrangements. How does coherent actuality emerge from infinite possibility? LRT proposes that constraint mechanisms are not optional additions but logically necessary features of any transition from possibility to actuality.

**Theorem (Constraint Necessity):** For any transition from infinite possibility to finite actuality, there exists a minimal necessary constraint set $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$ such that:
1. Any weaker constraint set fails to produce coherent actuality
2. Any alternative constraint set must embed or presuppose $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$
3. $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$ = {Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle}

**Proof Sketch:**
- **Without Identity**: No entity remains the same across time. Without A = A, no persistent structures can form, no measurement outcomes can be stable, and no physical laws can be consistently identified. The universe degenerates into structureless flux.
- **Without Non-Contradiction**: Statements A and ¬A can be simultaneously true. This leads to logical explosion (ex falso quodlibet): all statements become derivable, and no distinction between possible and impossible states can be maintained. Information space collapses into triviality.
- **Without Excluded Middle**: No definite states exist. Systems hover in permanent indeterminacy, never resolving to specific configurations. Measurement becomes impossible, not merely difficult, because there is no binary distinction between "this outcome" versus "not this outcome."

Therefore, the three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL) constitute the irreducible minimum for coherent actuality. Any attempt to derive physical reality from more primitive principles either presupposes these laws implicitly or fails to produce coherent results.

### 2.2 The Information Space

The information space $\mathcal{I}$ is not a physical container but a pre-physical logical structure: the totality of distinguishable states before actualization. Formally, we model $\mathcal{I}$ as an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\infty$, though this mathematical representation is epistemic (our best tool for analysis), not ontological (the thing itself).

Key properties of $\mathcal{I}$:
- **Dimensionality**: $\dim(\mathcal{I}) = \infty$. There is no a priori bound on the number of distinguishable configurations.
- **Completeness**: $\mathcal{I}$ contains all logically possible states, including those filtered out by $\mathfrak{L}$.
- **Pre-geometric**: $\mathcal{I}$ does not presuppose spatial geometry. Geometric structure emerges later through the hierarchical process (Section 3).
- **Pre-temporal**: Time does not flow within $\mathcal{I}$ itself. Temporal ordering emerges from identity constraints on actualized states.

The inner product structure $\langle \psi | \phi \rangle$ on $\mathcal{I}$ represents distinguishability: states are identical when $|\langle \psi | \phi \rangle|^2 = 1$, orthogonal when $|\langle \psi | \phi \rangle|^2 = 0$, and partially distinguishable otherwise. This structure does not assume quantum mechanics; rather, quantum mechanics will emerge as the optimal way to navigate $\mathcal{I}$ under logical constraints.

### 2.3 The Logical Filtering Operator

The logical operator $\mathfrak{L}$ is a functional mapping $\mathfrak{L}: \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}$ that imposes coherence requirements on information states. It is composed of three sub-operators corresponding to the 3FLL:

$$\mathfrak{L} = \mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}} \circ \mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}} \circ \mathfrak{L}_{\text{Id}}$$

where:
- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{Id}}$ (Identity)**: Enforces persistence. For a state $|\psi\rangle$ at logical step $\tau$ and $\tau + \delta\tau$, identity requires continuous evolution: $\langle \psi(\tau) | \psi(\tau + \delta\tau) \rangle \approx 1$ for small $\delta\tau$. This constraint generates time evolution (Section 5.3) and conservation laws via Noether's theorem.

- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}}$ (Non-Contradiction)**: Enforces consistency. States $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\neg\psi\rangle$ (logical opposites) cannot simultaneously have actualization measure greater than zero in the same localized context. Mathematically, this is expressed as Born rule constraints on probability amplitudes: $\sum_i |\langle \psi_i | \psi \rangle|^2 = 1$ (Section 5.1).

- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ (Excluded Middle)**: Enforces definiteness. Upon measurement-like interactions, superposition states must resolve to definite outcomes. This produces decoherence and measurement collapse as logical necessities, not additional postulates. The coupling of $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ to superposition states generates the T2/T1 < 1 prediction (Section 6).

The composition order matters: identity establishes entities, non-contradiction prevents logical explosion, and excluded middle forces resolution. Together, these operators reduce the infinite information space $\mathcal{I}$ to the finite actualized space $\mathcal{A}$:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Critically, $\mathfrak{L}$ does not *create* physical reality; it *filters* possibility space to reveal coherent actuality. Physical laws and constants emerge downstream of this filtering process (Section 3).

### 2.4 Bootstrap Function: Constraints as Enablers

The 3FLL do not directly generate mathematical structures or physical laws. Instead, they function as **bootstrap constraints** that:
1. **Enable** the possibility of coherence by filtering contradictory and indefinite states
2. **Create** preconditions for additional logical structures to emerge (proto-mathematical primitives, then mathematics)
3. **Stabilize** emergent patterns through consistency requirements

This resolves a potential circularity: we are not claiming that three simple laws directly generate infinite mathematical richness. Rather, the 3FLL establish minimal coherence, which permits proto-mathematical primitives (distinction, membership, relation, succession) to crystallize, which in turn enable mathematics to emerge as a unified structure, which then provides the infrastructure for physical laws (Section 3).

The hierarchy is:
$$\mathfrak{L}_0 \text{ (3FLL)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_1 \text{ (proto-primitives)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_2 \text{ (mathematics)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_3 \text{ (physical math)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_{4+} \text{ (physical laws)}$$

Section 2 focuses on $\mathfrak{L}_0$ alone; Section 3 presents the full hierarchical mechanism.

### 2.5 Mind-Independence and Ontological Status

A common objection: "Aren't logical laws human constructs, products of evolutionary psychology or cultural convention?" LRT rejects this view. The 3FLL are ontological features of reality, not epistemic tools invented by minds.

**Evidence for mind-independence:**
- **Pre-human operation**: The 3FLL constrained physical processes for 13.8 billion years before humans evolved. Stars formed, galaxies emerged, chemistry occurred—all governed by logical coherence requirements that operated without observers.
- **Observer-independent predictions**: LRT's T2/T1 prediction does not depend on human knowledge, experimental setup choices, or cultural context. If logical constraints are real, quantum systems must exhibit specific decoherence behavior regardless of who measures them.
- **Counterfactual stability**: If humans disappeared tomorrow, stars would continue fusing hydrogen, atoms would remain stable, and contradictory states would remain unactualized. The 3FLL are features of reality's structure, not features of minds representing reality.

This does not mean we can access logical constraints without mathematical models—we cannot. The distinction is between ontology (what exists) and epistemology (how we know it). $\mathfrak{L}$ operates ontologically; Hilbert spaces, operators, and mathematical formalisms are epistemic tools we use to describe $\mathfrak{L}$'s action.

**Analogy**: Gravity shaped planetary orbits before Newton formalized $F = Gm_1m_2/r^2$. The mathematical model is our representation; the gravitational constraint is the reality. Similarly, logical constraints operated before we formalized them, and our mathematical representations (Hilbert spaces, density matrices) are models, not the constraints themselves.

### 2.6 Necessity, Contingency, and the Physical Laws

A final clarification: LRT distinguishes between necessary and contingent features of reality.

**Necessary (universal across all possible realities)**:
- The 3FLL ($\mathfrak{L}_0$): Required for any coherent actuality
- Proto-mathematical primitives ($\mathfrak{L}_1$): Highly constrained by coherence requirements

**Contingent (specific to our universe)**:
- Specific physical constants (fine structure constant, cosmological constant)
- Particular gauge groups (SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) for Standard Model)
- Initial conditions of our universe

**Intermediate (constrained but not uniquely determined)**:
- Mathematical structures ($\mathfrak{L}_2$): Multiple valid structures, all internally consistent
- Physical frameworks ($\mathfrak{L}_3$): Quantum mechanics, relativity emerge from coherence + symmetry requirements, but alternative frameworks might exist

This hierarchy explains why quantum mechanics appears universal (it emerges from necessary logical constraints filtered through contingent symmetry structures) while remaining falsifiable (alternative constraint realizations might produce different decoherence signatures or modified predictions).

The next section presents the full hierarchical emergence mechanism, showing precisely how mathematical structures crystallize from proto-primitives enabled by the 3FLL.
