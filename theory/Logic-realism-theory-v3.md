## Abstract

We present Logic Realism Theory (LRT), a framework in which quantum mechanics emerges from information-theoretic constraints imposed by three fundamental logical laws: identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle (3FLL). Formalized as **A = L(I)**—where A represents physical actualization, L the logical constraints, and I an infinite information space—LRT derives quantum phenomena that standard quantum mechanics postulates. The theory predicts that superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than classical states due to Excluded Middle coupling, yielding a testable signature: **T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9** (vs. ~1.0 in conventional quantum mechanics). This prediction is derived from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, making it falsifiable on current quantum hardware across superconducting, trapped-ion, and topological platforms. We present the mathematical framework, key derivations (Born rule, Hilbert space structure, time evolution), hierarchical emergence mechanism (logic → proto-mathematics → mathematics → physics), and formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant (~1,500 lines, 0 axioms in core proofs). Experimental protocols demonstrate >95% statistical power with 150 hours per quantum backend. Additional predictions include state-dependent Hamiltonian shifts and entropy-conditioned scaling in quantum error correction.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem: Can We Derive Quantum Mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is among the most successful theories in physics, yet its foundational postulates remain unexplained. The Born rule, Hilbert space structure, unitary evolution, and measurement collapse are introduced as axioms rather than derived from deeper principles (Dirac 1930; von Neumann 1932). This raises fundamental questions: *Why* does quantum mechanics take this particular mathematical form? *Why* do superposition and entanglement govern microscopic physics? Could these phenomena emerge from more fundamental constraints?

Recent efforts to derive quantum mechanics from information-theoretic principles (Hardy 2001; Chiribella et al. 2011; Höhn 2017) demonstrate progress but typically introduce new axioms—purification, reversibility, or specific operational postulates—leaving the question of ultimate foundations unresolved. Wheeler's "it from bit" program (Wheeler 1990) suggested that information might be more fundamental than spacetime, but did not provide a mechanism for how bits become its.

### 1.2 The Proposal: Logic as Bootstrap Constraint

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes a radical simplification: physical reality emerges from logical coherence requirements on an infinite information space. The three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL)—identity (A = A), non-contradiction (¬(A ∧ ¬A)), and excluded middle (A ∨ ¬A)—operate as ontological constraints that filter infinite possibility into finite actuality. These laws are not human constructs but pre-mathematical, pre-physical features of reality that operated before humans evolved and would continue operating if humans disappeared.

The core formalism is deceptively simple:

**A = L(I)**

where:
- **I**: Infinite information space containing all logically possible configurations
- **L**: Filtering operator composed of the 3FLL
- **A**: Physical actualization—the subset of I that manifests as observable reality

This is not merely a metaphor. LRT provides explicit mathematical mappings showing how quantum mechanics emerges from L's action on I through a hierarchical process: logical constraints → proto-mathematical primitives → mathematical structures → physical laws. Crucially, geometry and arithmetic co-emerge at the mathematical layer; neither is privileged or presupposed.

### 1.3 Key Result: A Testable Prediction

Unlike purely philosophical approaches, LRT makes quantitative predictions about quantum systems. The Excluded Middle constraint, which forces binary resolution during measurement, couples to quantum superposition states. This coupling produces an additional decoherence channel beyond environmental effects. Our central prediction:

**Superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than would be expected from amplitude damping (T1 relaxation) alone.**

Quantitatively, the ratio of coherence time T2 (dephasing) to relaxation time T1 (amplitude damping) is:

**T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9**

This contrasts with conventional quantum mechanics, which predicts T2/T1 ≈ 1.0 for intrinsic decoherence in the absence of environmental noise. The deviation arises from Excluded Middle imposing entropy production proportional to Shannon entropy of superposition: ΔS_EM = ln(2) for equal superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩.

This prediction is:
- **Falsifiable**: Values consistently near 1.0 would invalidate LRT
- **Universal**: Independent of qubit implementation (superconducting, ion trap, topological)
- **Observable**: Testable with current quantum hardware using ~150 hours per backend
- **First-principles**: Derived from Fisher information geometry, not fitted to data

We have validated the experimental protocol via QuTiP simulation (>95% statistical power, ±2.8% error budget) and comprehensive confound analysis. The prediction awaits hardware testing.

### 1.4 Roadmap

This paper proceeds as follows:

**Section 2** presents the core thesis A = L(I), including the necessity of the 3FLL, the nature of information space I, and the human mind-independence of logical constraints.

**Section 3** introduces the hierarchical emergence framework, showing how proto-mathematical primitives (distinction, membership, relation, succession) emerge from the 3FLL, enabling mathematics to crystallize, which then provides infrastructure for physical laws. This resolves the "geometry vs. logic priority" question: they co-emerge.

**Section 4** provides mathematical formalization, including the Hilbert space model (epistemic tool, not ontology), constraint operator algebra, and the K-threshold framework distinguishing unitary (fixed K) from non-unitary (measurement, K → K-ΔK) regimes.

**Section 5** demonstrates that quantum mechanics emerges from LRT: Born rule from maximum entropy + non-contradiction, Hilbert space structure from information geometry, time evolution from identity constraint, and measurement as K-transition. We present a comparison table showing what LRT derives versus what QM postulates.

**Section 6** derives the T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 prediction from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, addressing the phenomenological parameter critique from peer review. We present confound isolation strategies and experimental protocols.

**Section 7** documents formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant: ~1,500 lines of verified code with 0 axioms in core derivations (3FLL proven from classical logic, not axiomatized). Key theorems include time emergence from identity, energy from Noether's theorem, and Russell's paradox filtering by non-contradiction.

**Section 8** provides comparative analysis distinguishing LRT from Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, pancomputationalism, and logical-structural realism, emphasizing discriminating predictions.

**Section 9** discusses objections, open questions, and future research directions.

**Section 10** concludes.

LRT offers a testable paradigm for quantum foundations that derives rather than postulates the core structure of quantum mechanics. The framework is falsifiable, computationally validated, and formally verified. Whether nature confirms our prediction that T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 will determine if logic truly constrains reality at the quantum scale.
