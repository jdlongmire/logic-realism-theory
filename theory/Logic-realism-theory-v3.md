## Abstract

We present Logic Realism Theory (LRT), a framework in which quantum mechanics emerges from information-theoretic constraints imposed by three fundamental logical laws: identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle (3FLL). Formalized as **$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$**—where $\mathcal{A}$ represents physical actualization, $\mathfrak{L}$ the logical constraints, and $\mathcal{I}$ an infinite information space—LRT derives quantum phenomena that standard quantum mechanics postulates. The theory predicts that superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than classical states due to Excluded Middle coupling, yielding a testable signature: **T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9** (vs. ~1.0 in conventional quantum mechanics). This prediction is derived from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, making it falsifiable on current quantum hardware across superconducting, trapped-ion, and topological platforms. We present the mathematical framework, key derivations (Born rule, Hilbert space structure, time evolution), hierarchical emergence mechanism (logic → proto-mathematics → mathematics → physics), and formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant (~1,500 lines; 3FLL proven from classical logic without LRT-specific axioms). Experimental protocols demonstrate >95% statistical power with 150 hours per quantum backend. Additional predictions include state-dependent Hamiltonian shifts and entropy-conditioned scaling in quantum error correction.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem: Can We Derive Quantum Mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is among the most successful theories in physics, yet its foundational postulates remain unexplained. The Born rule, Hilbert space structure, unitary evolution, and measurement collapse are introduced as axioms rather than derived from deeper principles (Dirac 1930; von Neumann 1932). This raises fundamental questions: *Why* does quantum mechanics take this particular mathematical form? *Why* do superposition and entanglement govern microscopic physics? Could these phenomena emerge from more fundamental constraints?

Recent efforts to derive quantum mechanics from information-theoretic principles (Hardy 2001; Chiribella et al. 2011; Höhn 2017) demonstrate progress but typically introduce new axioms—purification, reversibility, or specific operational postulates—leaving the question of ultimate foundations unresolved. Wheeler's "it from bit" program (Wheeler 1990) suggested that information might be more fundamental than spacetime, but did not provide a mechanism for how bits become its.

### 1.2 The Proposal: Logic as Bootstrap Constraint

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes a radical simplification: physical reality emerges from logical coherence requirements on an infinite information space. The three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL)—identity (A = A), non-contradiction (¬(A ∧ ¬A)), and excluded middle (A ∨ ¬A)—operate as ontological constraints that filter infinite possibility into finite actuality. These laws are not human constructs but pre-mathematical, pre-physical features of reality that operated before humans evolved and would continue operating if humans disappeared.

The core formalism is deceptively simple:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

where:
- **$\mathcal{I}$**: Infinite information space containing all logically possible configurations
- **$\mathfrak{L}$**: Filtering operator composed of the 3FLL
- **$\mathcal{A}$**: Physical actualization—the subset of $\mathcal{I}$ that manifests as observable reality

**Notation**: We use calligraphic typeface ($\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{I}$) for actualization and information space, and Fraktur typeface ($\mathfrak{L}$) for the logical filtering operator to distinguish from conventional physics notation (e.g., $\mathcal{L}$ for Lagrangian).

This is not merely a metaphor. LRT provides explicit mathematical mappings showing how quantum mechanics emerges from $\mathfrak{L}$'s action on $\mathcal{I}$ through a hierarchical process: logical constraints → proto-mathematical primitives → mathematical structures → physical laws. Crucially, geometry and arithmetic co-emerge at the mathematical layer; neither is privileged or presupposed.

### 1.3 Key Result: A Testable Prediction

Unlike purely philosophical approaches, LRT makes quantitative predictions about quantum systems. The Excluded Middle constraint, which forces binary resolution during measurement, couples to quantum superposition states. This coupling produces an additional decoherence channel beyond environmental effects. Our central prediction:

**Superposition states decohere 10-30% faster than would be expected from amplitude damping (T1 relaxation) alone.**

Quantitatively, the ratio of coherence time T2 (dephasing) to relaxation time T1 (amplitude damping) is:

**T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9**

This contrasts with conventional quantum mechanics, which predicts T2/T1 ≈ 1.0 for intrinsic decoherence in the absence of environmental noise. The deviation arises from Excluded Middle imposing entropy production proportional to Shannon entropy of superposition: ΔS_EM = ln(2) for equal superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩.

This prediction is:
- **Falsifiable**: Values consistently near 1.0 would invalidate LRT
- **Universal**: Independent of qubit implementation (superconducting, ion trap, topological)
- **Observable**: Testable with current quantum hardware using ~150 hours per backend
- **First-principles**: Derived from Fisher information geometry, not fitted to data

We have validated the experimental protocol via QuTiP simulation (>95% statistical power, ±2.8% error budget) and comprehensive confound analysis. The prediction awaits hardware testing.

### 1.4 Roadmap

This paper proceeds as follows:

**Section 2** presents the core thesis $\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$, including the necessity of the 3FLL, the nature of information space $\mathcal{I}$, and the human mind-independence of logical constraints.

**Section 3** introduces the hierarchical emergence framework, showing how proto-mathematical primitives (distinction, membership, relation, succession) emerge from the 3FLL, enabling mathematics to crystallize, which then provides infrastructure for physical laws. This resolves the "geometry vs. logic priority" question: they co-emerge.

**Section 4** provides mathematical formalization, including the Hilbert space model (epistemic tool, not ontology), constraint operator algebra, and the K-threshold framework distinguishing unitary (fixed K) from non-unitary (measurement, K → K-ΔK) regimes.

**Section 5** demonstrates that quantum mechanics emerges from LRT: Born rule from maximum entropy + non-contradiction, Hilbert space structure from information geometry, time evolution from identity constraint, and measurement as K-transition. We present a comparison table showing what LRT derives versus what QM postulates.

**Section 6** derives the T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 prediction from first principles using Fisher information geometry on constraint-filtered state spaces, addressing the phenomenological parameter critique from peer review. We present confound isolation strategies and experimental protocols.

**Section 7** documents formal verification via Lean 4 proof assistant: ~1,500 lines of verified code. The 3FLL are proven from Lean's classical logic foundation without LRT-specific axioms. Established mathematical theorems (Stone, Jaynes MaxEnt, Spohn) are used as building blocks. Key LRT theorems include time emergence from identity, energy from Noether's theorem, and Russell's paradox filtering by non-contradiction.

**Section 8** provides comparative analysis distinguishing LRT from Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, pancomputationalism, and logical-structural realism, emphasizing discriminating predictions.

**Section 9** discusses objections, open questions, and future research directions.

**Section 10** concludes.

LRT offers a testable paradigm for quantum foundations that derives rather than postulates the core structure of quantum mechanics. The framework is falsifiable, computationally validated, and formally verified. Whether nature confirms our prediction that T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 will determine if logic truly constrains reality at the quantum scale.

## 2. Core Thesis: Bootstrap Ontology

### 2.1 The Necessity Argument

Consider an infinite information space containing all logically possible states—including contradictory configurations, incoherent superpositions, and physically impossible arrangements. How does coherent actuality emerge from infinite possibility? LRT proposes that constraint mechanisms are not optional additions but logically necessary features of any transition from possibility to actuality.

**Theorem (Constraint Necessity):** For any transition from infinite possibility to finite actuality, there exists a minimal necessary constraint set $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$ such that:
1. Any weaker constraint set fails to produce coherent actuality
2. Any alternative constraint set must embed or presuppose $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$
3. $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{min}}$ = {Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle}

**Proof Sketch:**
- **Without Identity**: No entity remains the same across time. Without A = A, no persistent structures can form, no measurement outcomes can be stable, and no physical laws can be consistently identified. The universe degenerates into structureless flux.
- **Without Non-Contradiction**: Statements A and ¬A can be simultaneously true. This leads to logical explosion (ex falso quodlibet): all statements become derivable, and no distinction between possible and impossible states can be maintained. Information space collapses into triviality.
- **Without Excluded Middle**: No definite states exist. Systems hover in permanent indeterminacy, never resolving to specific configurations. Measurement becomes impossible, not merely difficult, because there is no binary distinction between "this outcome" versus "not this outcome."

Therefore, the three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL) constitute the irreducible minimum for coherent actuality. Any attempt to derive physical reality from more primitive principles either presupposes these laws implicitly or fails to produce coherent results.

### 2.2 The Information Space

The information space $\mathcal{I}$ is not a physical container but a pre-physical logical structure: the totality of distinguishable states before actualization. Formally, we model $\mathcal{I}$ as an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\infty$, though this mathematical representation is epistemic (our best tool for analysis), not ontological (the thing itself).

Key properties of $\mathcal{I}$:
- **Dimensionality**: $\dim(\mathcal{I}) = \infty$. There is no a priori bound on the number of distinguishable configurations.
- **Completeness**: $\mathcal{I}$ contains all logically possible states, including those filtered out by $\mathfrak{L}$.
- **Pre-geometric**: $\mathcal{I}$ does not presuppose spatial geometry. Geometric structure emerges later through the hierarchical process (Section 3).
- **Pre-temporal**: Time does not flow within $\mathcal{I}$ itself. Temporal ordering emerges from identity constraints on actualized states.

The inner product structure $\langle \psi | \phi \rangle$ on $\mathcal{I}$ represents distinguishability: states are identical when $|\langle \psi | \phi \rangle|^2 = 1$, orthogonal when $|\langle \psi | \phi \rangle|^2 = 0$, and partially distinguishable otherwise. This structure does not assume quantum mechanics; rather, quantum mechanics will emerge as the optimal way to navigate $\mathcal{I}$ under logical constraints.

### 2.3 The Logical Filtering Operator

The logical operator $\mathfrak{L}$ is a functional mapping $\mathfrak{L}: \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}$ that imposes coherence requirements on information states. It is composed of three sub-operators corresponding to the 3FLL:

$$\mathfrak{L} = \mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}} \circ \mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}} \circ \mathfrak{L}_{\text{Id}}$$

where:
- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{Id}}$ (Identity)**: Enforces persistence. For a state $|\psi\rangle$ at logical step $\tau$ and $\tau + \delta\tau$, identity requires continuous evolution: $\langle \psi(\tau) | \psi(\tau + \delta\tau) \rangle \approx 1$ for small $\delta\tau$. This constraint generates time evolution (Section 5.3) and conservation laws via Noether's theorem.

- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}}$ (Non-Contradiction)**: Enforces consistency. States $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\neg\psi\rangle$ (logical opposites) cannot simultaneously have actualization measure greater than zero in the same localized context. Mathematically, this is expressed as Born rule constraints on probability amplitudes: $\sum_i |\langle \psi_i | \psi \rangle|^2 = 1$ (Section 5.1).

- **$\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ (Excluded Middle)**: Enforces definiteness. Upon measurement-like interactions, superposition states must resolve to definite outcomes. This produces decoherence and measurement collapse as logical necessities, not additional postulates. The coupling of $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ to superposition states generates the T2/T1 < 1 prediction (Section 6).

The composition order matters: identity establishes entities, non-contradiction prevents logical explosion, and excluded middle forces resolution. Together, these operators reduce the infinite information space $\mathcal{I}$ to the finite actualized space $\mathcal{A}$:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Critically, $\mathfrak{L}$ does not *create* physical reality; it *filters* possibility space to reveal coherent actuality. Physical laws and constants emerge downstream of this filtering process (Section 3).

### 2.4 Bootstrap Function: Constraints as Enablers

The 3FLL do not directly generate mathematical structures or physical laws. Instead, they function as **bootstrap constraints** that:
1. **Enable** the possibility of coherence by filtering contradictory and indefinite states
2. **Create** preconditions for additional logical structures to emerge (proto-mathematical primitives, then mathematics)
3. **Stabilize** emergent patterns through consistency requirements

This resolves a potential circularity: we are not claiming that three simple laws directly generate infinite mathematical richness. Rather, the 3FLL establish minimal coherence, which permits proto-mathematical primitives (distinction, membership, relation, succession) to crystallize, which in turn enable mathematics to emerge as a unified structure, which then provides the infrastructure for physical laws (Section 3).

The hierarchy is:
$$\mathfrak{L}_0 \text{ (3FLL)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_1 \text{ (proto-primitives)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_2 \text{ (mathematics)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_3 \text{ (physical math)} \rightarrow \mathfrak{L}_{4+} \text{ (physical laws)}$$

Section 2 focuses on $\mathfrak{L}_0$ alone; Section 3 presents the full hierarchical mechanism.

### 2.5 Mind-Independence and Ontological Status

A common objection: "Aren't logical laws human constructs, products of evolutionary psychology or cultural convention?" LRT rejects this view. The 3FLL are ontological features of reality, not epistemic tools invented by minds.

**Evidence for mind-independence:**
- **Pre-human operation**: The 3FLL constrained physical processes for 13.8 billion years before humans evolved. Stars formed, galaxies emerged, chemistry occurred—all governed by logical coherence requirements that operated without observers.
- **Observer-independent predictions**: LRT's T2/T1 prediction does not depend on human knowledge, experimental setup choices, or cultural context. If logical constraints are real, quantum systems must exhibit specific decoherence behavior regardless of who measures them.
- **Counterfactual stability**: If humans disappeared tomorrow, stars would continue fusing hydrogen, atoms would remain stable, and contradictory states would remain unactualized. The 3FLL are features of reality's structure, not features of minds representing reality.

This does not mean we can access logical constraints without mathematical models—we cannot. The distinction is between ontology (what exists) and epistemology (how we know it). $\mathfrak{L}$ operates ontologically; Hilbert spaces, operators, and mathematical formalisms are epistemic tools we use to describe $\mathfrak{L}$'s action.

**Analogy**: Gravity shaped planetary orbits before Newton formalized $F = Gm_1m_2/r^2$. The mathematical model is our representation; the gravitational constraint is the reality. Similarly, logical constraints operated before we formalized them, and our mathematical representations (Hilbert spaces, density matrices) are models, not the constraints themselves.

### 2.6 Necessity, Contingency, and the Physical Laws

A final clarification: LRT distinguishes between necessary and contingent features of reality.

**Necessary (universal across all possible realities)**:
- The 3FLL ($\mathfrak{L}_0$): Required for any coherent actuality
- Proto-mathematical primitives ($\mathfrak{L}_1$): Highly constrained by coherence requirements

**Contingent (specific to our universe)**:
- Specific physical constants (fine structure constant, cosmological constant)
- Particular gauge groups (SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) for Standard Model)
- Initial conditions of our universe

**Intermediate (constrained but not uniquely determined)**:
- Mathematical structures ($\mathfrak{L}_2$): Multiple valid structures, all internally consistent
- Physical frameworks ($\mathfrak{L}_3$): Quantum mechanics, relativity emerge from coherence + symmetry requirements, but alternative frameworks might exist

This hierarchy explains why quantum mechanics appears universal (it emerges from necessary logical constraints filtered through contingent symmetry structures) while remaining falsifiable (alternative constraint realizations might produce different decoherence signatures or modified predictions).

The next section presents the full hierarchical emergence mechanism, showing precisely how mathematical structures crystallize from proto-primitives enabled by the 3FLL.

## 3. Hierarchical Emergence: From Logic to Physics

### 3.1 The Layered Structure

Section 2 established that the 3FLL ($\mathfrak{L}_0$) are necessary but not sufficient for physical reality. We now formalize how richer structures emerge through a hierarchical process. The full LRT thesis is not the simple $\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$, but rather:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}_n \circ \mathfrak{L}_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ \mathfrak{L}_2 \circ \mathfrak{L}_1 \circ \mathfrak{L}_0(\mathcal{I})$$

where each layer $\mathfrak{L}_k$ applies constraints that:
1. Are consistent with all prior layers $\mathfrak{L}_{0}, \ldots, \mathfrak{L}_{k-1}$
2. Reduce entropy of the filtered information space
3. Exhibit stability under perturbations

The layers are:
- **$\mathfrak{L}_0$ (Layer 0)**: 3FLL bootstrap constraints
- **$\mathfrak{L}_1$ (Layer 1)**: Proto-mathematical primitives
- **$\mathfrak{L}_2$ (Layer 2)**: Mathematical structures (co-emergence of geometry, arithmetic, algebra)
- **$\mathfrak{L}_3$ (Layer 3)**: Physics-enabling mathematics (Lie groups, manifolds, Hilbert spaces)
- **$\mathfrak{L}_{4+}$ (Layers 4+)**: Physical laws, constants, and specific solutions

**Crucially**: Each layer emerges from the prior layer, not from $\mathfrak{L}_0$ directly. The 3FLL do not generate mathematics; they enable proto-primitives, which enable mathematics, which enables physics.

### 3.2 Layer 0 → Layer 1: Proto-Mathematical Primitives

The 3FLL establish coherence, but coherence alone is not mathematics. What immediately follows from coherence are **proto-mathematical primitives**—pre-formal concepts that make mathematics possible:

#### Distinction
From Identity ($A = A$) comes the possibility of distinguishing $A$ from $B$. If entities persist with identity, they can be different from other entities. This is not yet set theory (which is Layer 2), but the precondition for it: you cannot have sets without first being able to distinguish elements.

#### Membership
From Excluded Middle ($A \lor \neg A$) comes definite inclusion/exclusion. An element is either in a collection or not; no third option. This proto-primitive enables set membership, but it is not yet formalized set theory—it is the logical prerequisite for it.

#### Relation
From all three laws together comes the concept of connection between entities. If $A$ and $B$ are identifiable and non-contradictory, we can ask whether they are related (causally, spatially, temporally). Relation is not yet a mathematical function; it is the proto-concept that enables functions to be defined.

#### Succession
From Identity applied iteratively comes the concept of "next." If $A$ maintains identity across logical steps, we can speak of $A$ at step 1, step 2, step 3, etc. This is the proto-concept that enables counting, ordering, and eventually number theory—but it is not yet the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$; it is the logical precondition for $\mathbb{N}$ to emerge.

These four proto-primitives are not mathematical objects. They are logical structures that crystallize once coherence is established, and they provide the substrate from which mathematics emerges.

### 3.3 Layer 1 → Layer 2: Mathematical Co-Emergence

From the four proto-primitives, mathematics emerges as a **unified, interconnected structure**. Importantly, different branches of mathematics arise simultaneously by interpreting the same primitives in different ways. There is no privileging of geometry over arithmetic, or vice versa—both co-emerge from the same logical substrate.

#### Arithmetic (Discrete Branch)
- **Proto-primitive**: Succession + Identity
- **Emergence**: Counting: 1, 2, 3, ... → Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ → Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ → Rationals $\mathbb{Q}$
- **Key operations**: Addition (iterate succession), multiplication (repeated addition)
- **Constraints**: Non-contradiction blocks inconsistent arithmetic (e.g., $1 \neq 2$)

#### Geometry (Continuous Branch)
- **Proto-primitives**: Distinction + Relation in continuous space
- **Emergence**: Points (distinguished entities) → Lines (relations between points) → Distances (quantified relations) → Metric spaces
- **Key structures**: Euclidean space, manifolds, curvature
- **Constraints**: Identity ensures geometric objects persist; Excluded Middle forces definite positions

#### Set Theory (Foundational Branch)
- **Proto-primitives**: Membership + Non-Contradiction
- **Emergence**: Collections of elements → Sets → Set operations (union, intersection, complement)
- **Key constraint**: Non-Contradiction blocks Russell's paradox: sets cannot contain themselves in ways that lead to contradiction
- **Note**: LRT's Lean 4 formalization (Section 7) includes explicit proof that $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}}$ filters Russell's paradox

#### Algebra (Abstract Branch)
- **Proto-primitives**: Succession + Relation + abstract operations
- **Emergence**: Binary operations → Groups → Rings → Fields
- **Key structures**: Symmetry groups, Lie algebras
- **Constraints**: Identity forces existence of identity elements; Non-Contradiction forces associativity, commutativity where applicable

#### Formal Logic (Meta-Mathematical Branch)
- **Proto-primitives**: Codification of $\mathfrak{L}_0$ itself
- **Emergence**: Propositional logic → Predicate logic → Modal logic
- **Key structures**: Axioms, inference rules, proofs
- **Important distinction**: Formal logic (Layer 2) is our symbolic representation of the ontological constraints (Layer 0). Gödel's incompleteness applies to formal systems (Layer 2), not to the ontological operation of $\mathfrak{L}_0$ itself (Section 2.5).

**Interconnections**: These branches are not independent. They inform and constrain each other:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Arithmetic} \times \text{Geometry} &\rightarrow \text{Analytic geometry (coordinates)} \\
\text{Algebra} \times \text{Geometry} &\rightarrow \text{Algebraic geometry} \\
\text{Set Theory} \times \text{Relation} &\rightarrow \text{Functions, mappings} \\
\text{Formal Logic} \times \text{Set Theory} &\rightarrow \text{Model theory}
\end{align*}$$

**Resolution of the Geometry Question**: Geometry is neither pre-logical (it does not precede $\mathfrak{L}_0$) nor post-physical (it does not require physics to exist). Geometry is mathematical (Layer 2), emerging alongside arithmetic from proto-primitives. The question "Is geometry fundamental or emergent?" dissolves: geometry and arithmetic co-emerge as complementary interpretations of the same logical substrate.

### 3.4 Layer 2 → Layer 3: Physics-Enabling Mathematics

Physics requires specialized mathematical structures that emerge from Layer 2 foundations:

#### Lie Groups and Continuous Symmetries
- **Layer 2 basis**: Algebra (group structure) + Geometry (continuous manifold)
- **Emergence**: Rotation groups $SO(3)$, Lorentz group $SO(3,1)$, gauge groups $SU(N)$
- **Physical role**: Continuous symmetries → Conservation laws via Noether's theorem (Section 5.4)

#### Differential Geometry
- **Layer 2 basis**: Geometry + Calculus (from arithmetic + continuous limits)
- **Emergence**: Manifolds, tangent spaces, curvature, covariant derivatives
- **Physical role**: Spacetime structure, general relativity, gauge field theories

#### Hilbert Spaces
- **Layer 2 basis**: Geometry (inner products) + Algebra (vector space structure) + Analysis (completeness)
- **Emergence**: Infinite-dimensional vector spaces with inner product
- **Physical role**: Quantum state spaces, superposition, entanglement, unitary evolution

#### Tensor Calculus
- **Layer 2 basis**: Algebra (multilinear maps) + Geometry (coordinate transformations)
- **Emergence**: Tensors, covariant/contravariant indices, Einstein summation
- **Physical role**: Coordinate-independent physical descriptions

These Layer 3 structures are not themselves physical; they are mathematical frameworks that physics uses. But they are more specialized than Layer 2 mathematics—they crystallize specifically because they enable physical descriptions under constraints.

### 3.5 Layers 3 → 4+: Physical Laws and Constants

Physical laws emerge when Layer 3 mathematical structures combine with logical constraints under specific boundary conditions:

#### Conservation Laws (Layer 4)
- **Layer 3 input**: Lie groups (continuous symmetries)
- **Logical constraint**: Identity requires invariance under continuous transformations
- **Physical output**: Energy conservation (time-translation symmetry), momentum conservation (spatial-translation symmetry), angular momentum conservation (rotational symmetry)
- **Formalism**: Noether's theorem connects symmetries to conserved quantities

#### Quantum Mechanics (Layer 4)
- **Layer 3 input**: Hilbert spaces, operators, inner products
- **Logical constraints**:
  - Identity → Unitary evolution ($U^\dagger U = I$)
  - Non-Contradiction → Born rule ($\sum_i |\langle \psi_i | \psi \rangle|^2 = 1$)
  - Excluded Middle → Measurement collapse (superposition → definite outcome)
- **Physical output**: Schrödinger equation, commutation relations, uncertainty principle

#### Gauge Theories (Layer 4)
- **Layer 3 input**: Lie groups, differential geometry, fiber bundles
- **Logical constraints**: Identity applied locally (gauge invariance)
- **Physical output**: Electromagnetism (U(1) gauge), weak force (SU(2) gauge), strong force (SU(3) gauge)

#### Specific Constants (Layer 5+)
- **Examples**: Fine structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, Higgs vacuum expectation value
- **Status**: Contingent. These are specific solutions to Layer 4 equations under our universe's boundary conditions. Alternative values might be consistent with logical constraints but yield different physical phenomenology.

The hierarchy thus explains both universality and contingency:
- **Universal**: Layers 0-3 are shared by all possible realities (logical + mathematical necessities)
- **Nearly universal**: Layer 4 physical frameworks (quantum mechanics, relativity) emerge from logical constraints + symmetries
- **Contingent**: Layer 5+ specific constants and initial conditions vary across possible universes

### 3.6 Entropy Reduction Through Layers

Each layer reduces entropy of the filtered information space. Formally, let $S(\mathcal{H}^{(k)})$ denote the entropy of the information space after applying layers 0 through $k$:

$$S(\mathcal{I}) > S(\mathcal{H}^{(0)}) > S(\mathcal{H}^{(1)}) > S(\mathcal{H}^{(2)}) > \cdots > S(\mathcal{A})$$

This monotonic entropy reduction reflects increasing coherence and structure. Physical actualization $\mathcal{A}$ is the final, highly constrained subset of $\mathcal{I}$.

**Testable implication**: Different layers should exhibit different decoherence timescales. Systems governed primarily by Layer 0 constraints (e.g., superposition under Excluded Middle) should decohere faster than systems governed only by Layer 4 physics (e.g., amplitude damping). This is the origin of the T2/T1 < 1 prediction (Section 6).

### 3.7 Philosophical Resolutions

The hierarchical emergence framework resolves several philosophical challenges:

**Complexity from simplicity**: Three simple laws do not directly generate infinite complexity. Rather, they bootstrap coherence, enabling proto-primitives, enabling mathematics, enabling physics. Complexity emerges through layered iteration.

**Geometry vs. logic priority**: Neither has priority. Logic (Layer 0) enables proto-primitives (Layer 1), which enable geometry and arithmetic simultaneously (Layer 2). Geometry is neither pre-logical nor post-logical; it co-emerges at the mathematical layer.

**Gödel's incompleteness**: Applies to formal logic (Layer 2), not to ontological operation of $\mathfrak{L}_0$. Our formal models may be incomplete, but the filtering mechanism is not a formal system—it operates ontologically, prior to formalization.

**Necessity vs. contingency**: Layers 0-1 are necessary, Layer 2 admits variations but is highly constrained, Layers 3-4 crystallize from symmetries and consistency requirements, Layer 5+ is contingent on specific universe parameters.

**Why privilege logic?**: The hierarchy clarifies this is not arbitrary: Layer 0 is necessarily foundational (coherence is impossible without it), while geometry, symmetry, and information theory emerge at later layers as consequences, not presuppositions.

The next section formalizes this hierarchical structure mathematically, introducing the constraint operator algebra and K-threshold framework that will be used to derive quantum mechanics (Section 5) and the T2/T1 prediction (Section 6).
