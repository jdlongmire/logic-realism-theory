## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic—Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle—are not merely rules of reasoning but ontological constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability. This foundational paper develops the case for logic realism through an abductive argument: the universal conformity of physical measurements to logical laws, despite apparent quantum challenges, is best explained by treating these laws as constitutive of reality rather than merely cognitive or conventional. We introduce the Infinite Information Space (IIS) as the totality of 3FLL-constituted distinguishable states and show that quantum mechanics emerges as the unique stable interface between this non-Boolean possibility space and Boolean actuality. The framework unifies longstanding debates in metaphysics, philosophy of logic, and quantum foundations while generating testable predictions. We preview the technical derivations establishing that complex quantum mechanics follows uniquely from logical constraints plus minimal physical assumptions, and discuss the confirmed prediction regarding complex (versus real) quantum amplitudes. LRT offers a novel resolution to the measurement problem and explains the "unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics in physics.

## 1. The Puzzle of Logical Structure in Physics

### 1.1 An Empirical Observation

Consider a simple empirical fact: no physical measurement, at any scale, in any domain, at any point in recorded history, has ever violated the Law of Identity, Non-Contradiction, or Excluded Middle at the level of measurement outcomes.

Every detector that has ever fired has recorded exactly one outcome—not zero, not two contradictory outcomes simultaneously. Every particle position measurement has yielded a determinate result. Every spin measurement has returned "up" or "down," never both, never neither. The photographic plates, cloud chambers, and silicon detectors of a century of physics display an unbroken record of logical conformity.

This observation is so mundane that it typically escapes notice. Yet it presents a genuine puzzle when juxtaposed with quantum mechanics.

### 1.2 The Apparent Quantum Challenge

Quantum mechanics describes systems in superposition: a particle can be in a state that is "neither spin-up nor spin-down" but some combination of both. The quantum formalism employs non-commuting observables, contextual properties, and non-Boolean event structures. Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) argued that quantum mechanics requires a revision of classical logic, replacing the distributive law with a weaker lattice structure.

If quantum mechanics describes reality, and quantum mechanics violates classical logic, should we not expect logical violations at the empirical level?

Yet we do not observe them. The measurement outcomes recorded in laboratory notebooks are relentlessly classical: determinate, non-contradictory, and complete. The "quantum weirdness" exists in the formalism and in our descriptions of unmeasured systems, but it never appears in the actual data.

### 1.3 Three Possible Explanations

How should we explain the universal conformity of physical outcomes to logical structure? Three families of explanation present themselves:

**Psychologism:** Logical laws describe how minds work. We cannot observe violations because we cannot think violations. The conformity is a cognitive artifact, not a feature of external reality.

**Conventionalism:** Logical laws are linguistic conventions that define the meanings of terms like "not," "and," and "or." Violations are not observed because they are definitionally excluded—a "contradictory outcome" would not count as an outcome at all.

**Realism:** Logical laws are objective constraints on reality itself. Violations are not observed because they cannot occur. The structure of physical distinguishability inherently conforms to logical law.

This paper defends the third option: **logic realism**. We argue that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) are constitutive conditions for physical distinguishability, and that this constitutional role explains both the universal conformity of measurements to logic and the peculiar structure of quantum mechanics.

### 1.4 The Stakes

The question is not merely academic. If logical laws are constitutive of physical reality, several consequences follow:

1. The structure of quantum mechanics becomes explicable rather than brute
2. The "measurement problem" admits a principled resolution
3. The effectiveness of mathematics in physics receives partial explanation
4. Constraints on future physics become identifiable

The logic realism thesis, if correct, fundamentally reorients the relationship between logic, mathematics, and physics.

## 2. The Logic Realism Thesis

### 2.1 The Three Fundamental Laws

The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) are:

| Law | Statement | Formal Expression |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| **Identity** | Everything is identical to itself | ∀x: x = x |
| **Non-Contradiction** | Nothing is both P and not-P | ¬(P ∧ ¬P) |
| **Excluded Middle** | Everything is either P or not-P | P ∨ ¬P |

These laws have been recognized since Aristotle as foundational to rational discourse. What is less commonly recognized is their potential role in constituting physical distinguishability.

### 2.2 The Constitutive Claim

**Logic Realism Thesis:** The 3FLL are not merely rules governing inference but ontological constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability.

By "constitutive," we mean that 3FLL are conditions for the possibility of distinguishability, not descriptions of an independently existing realm. Just as the rules of chess constitute what counts as a legal move (rather than describing pre-existing chess facts), 3FLL constitute what counts as a distinguishable state.

The distinction is crucial. A *descriptive* claim about logic would say: "The world happens to obey logical laws." A *constitutive* claim says: "Logical laws make the concept of 'distinguishable state' possible in the first place."

### 2.3 The Constitutive Argument

The argument proceeds as follows:

**Premise 1:** Physical measurement yields determinate outcomes.

This is an empirical observation. Every measurement ever performed has produced a definite result.

**Premise 2:** Determinate outcomes require distinguishability.

A measurement is informative only if it can distinguish between alternatives. A "measurement" that cannot tell spin-up from spin-down has not measured spin.

**Premise 3:** Distinguishability presupposes 3FLL.

For states s₁ and s₂ to be distinguishable:
- Each must be self-identical (else there is no "s₁" or "s₂" to distinguish)
- They cannot be both identical and non-identical (else the distinction is incoherent)
- They must be either identical or non-identical (else the question has no answer)

**Conclusion:** Physical measurement presupposes 3FLL as constitutive conditions.

This is not the trivial claim that we *think using* 3FLL. It is the substantive claim that 3FLL are conditions for there being anything to measure at all.

### 2.4 The Formal Expression: A = L(I)

LRT expresses the relationship between logic and actuality in a compact formula:

$$A = L(I)$$

Where:
- **I** = Infinite Information Space (the totality of distinguishable configurations)
- **L** = The logical filtering operation (3FLL-conformity check)
- **A** = Actuality (the Boolean realm of determinate outcomes)

This formula captures the core claim: actuality is what remains when the space of distinguishable possibilities is filtered through logical constraints. The formula is not a derivation but a summary of the structural relationship.

### 2.5 Scope and Limits

The logic realism thesis applies primarily to physical distinguishability. We make no claims about:

- Abstract mathematical objects (whether they "obey" 3FLL is a separate question)
- Fictional or hypothetical scenarios (logical consistency is not required for imaginability)
- Future extensions of physics (LRT may require modification)

The thesis is also compatible with non-classical logics *at the level of quantum propositions*. What LRT requires is that 3FLL hold at the level of measurement outcomes—a requirement that quantum mechanics itself respects.

---

## 3. The Abductive Argument for Logic Realism

### 3.1 The Structure of Abduction

Abductive reasoning (inference to the best explanation) proceeds from observations to the hypothesis that best explains them. The logic realism thesis is supported by abduction from two key observations:

**Observation 1:** No physical measurement has ever violated 3FLL at the outcome level.

**Observation 2:** Physical systems have the capacity to detect and record distinguishable states (measurement is possible).

These observations require explanation. Several candidate explanations exist; we argue that logic realism provides the best one.

### 3.2 Rival Explanations

**Coincidence:** The conformity of measurements to logic is a cosmic coincidence. Physical law happens to produce logical outcomes, but there is no deeper connection.

*Problem:* This explanation has zero predictive power and maximal arbitrariness. Why should contingent physical processes respect necessary logical structure? The coincidence would be truly extraordinary.

**Kantianism:** Logical structure is imposed by the mind on experience. We observe logical conformity because our cognitive apparatus cannot represent violations.

*Problem:* This makes the success of physics mysterious. If logic is merely cognitive, why do logically structured theories (quantum mechanics, relativity) successfully predict novel phenomena? The Kantian view predicts that logic should be useful for organizing experience but not for discovering features of mind-independent reality.

**Conventionalism:** Logical vocabulary is defined to exclude violations. A "contradictory measurement outcome" is oxymoronic by definition.

*Problem:* This relocates rather than solves the problem. Why do our conventions track physical reality? If we defined "outcome" to permit contradictions, we would still never observe them. The convention reflects rather than creates the regularity.

**Quantum Logic:** Classical logic fails at the quantum level. The conformity at the outcome level is an emergent phenomenon from fundamentally non-classical processes.

*Problem:* This inverts the explanatory order. Quantum logic describes the structure of quantum *propositions*, not measurement *outcomes*. The outcomes remain stubbornly classical. If anything, the persistence of classical outcomes despite quantum processes demands explanation—and logic realism provides it.

### 3.3 The Logic Realism Explanation

Logic realism explains both observations directly:

**Why no violations?** Because 3FLL are constitutive of distinguishability. A "violation" would not be a distinguishable event at all—it would be nothing.

**Why is measurement possible?** Because the physical world instantiates the distinguishability structure that 3FLL constitute. Measurement is possible precisely because reality conforms to the conditions that make distinguishability possible.

Moreover, logic realism generates predictions:

1. Future measurements will continue to conform to 3FLL
2. The structure of physical theory is constrained by distinguishability requirements
3. Specific features of quantum mechanics (Hilbert space, Born rule, unitarity) are derivable from 3FLL plus minimal physical constraints

The third prediction is the subject of the technical companion paper, where the derivation is carried out in full.

### 3.4 Explanatory Virtues

Logic realism exhibits superior explanatory virtues:

| Criterion | Coincidence | Kantianism | Conventionalism | Logic Realism |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Predictive power | None | Low | None | High |
| Unification | None | Partial | None | High |
| Parsimony | Low (unexplained regularity) | Medium | Medium | High |
| Falsifiability | No | Weak | No | Yes |

The case for logic realism is not demonstrative but abductive: it is the best explanation of the observed facts.

## 4. From Logic to Physics: The Interface

### 4.1 The Infinite Information Space

If 3FLL constitute distinguishability, what is the totality of distinguishable configurations? LRT calls this the **Infinite Information Space (IIS)**.

**Definition:** The IIS is the maximal set of states such that:
1. Each state is self-identical (Identity)
2. Each pair is either identical or distinguishable (Excluded Middle)
3. No state is both identical and non-identical to another (Non-Contradiction)
4. The space is closed under the operations that preserve distinguishability

The IIS is not a physical container but a logical characterization: it is whatever satisfies the distinguishability constraints imposed by 3FLL.

### 4.2 Non-Boolean Structure

A crucial feature of IIS is its **non-Boolean** structure. In Boolean logic, propositions are either true or false, and the logical operations satisfy familiar laws (distributivity, excluded middle for compounds, etc.).

The IIS admits a richer structure:
- If states s₁ and s₂ are distinguishable, so are their superpositions
- The space is closed under linear combination
- The "logic" of IIS propositions is non-distributive (quantum logic)

This non-Boolean structure is not a departure from 3FLL but a *consequence* of applying 3FLL to a sufficiently rich distinguishability space. Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle hold for individual states; what fails is the distributive law for compound propositions about superpositions.

### 4.3 Boolean Actuality

In contrast, measurement outcomes are **Boolean**:
- Every measurement yields exactly one outcome
- Outcomes are mutually exclusive
- Some outcome occurs (no "null" measurements)

This is the realm of laboratory notebooks, detector clicks, and experimental data. It obeys classical logic without exception.

### 4.4 The Interface Problem

The central structural problem is: **How does non-Boolean IIS connect to Boolean actuality?**

This is a generalization of the quantum measurement problem. Standard formulations ask: "How does superposition become definite outcome?" LRT asks: "What structure mediates between non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality?"

The answer: **quantum mechanics**.

### 4.5 Quantum Mechanics as Interface

The interface between IIS and Boolean actuality must satisfy several constraints:

1. **Embedding:** It must represent the full distinguishability structure of IIS
2. **Probability:** It must assign probabilities to Boolean outcomes
3. **Consistency:** Probability assignments must be non-contradictory
4. **Completeness:** Every state must yield some outcome distribution

These constraints uniquely determine complex quantum mechanics (see Section 6 for the technical preview).

The relationship can be visualized:

### 4.6 The Uniqueness Claim

LRT makes a strong claim: quantum mechanics is the *unique* stable interface structure.

"Stable" means:
- Physical stability: admits bound states, atoms, chemistry, observers
- Interface stability: small perturbations produce small outcome changes
- Compositional stability: no signaling under arbitrary system composition

Alternatives fail:
- Classical mechanics: no bound states (Earnshaw's theorem)
- Real quantum mechanics: fails local tomography
- Quaternionic quantum mechanics: fails tensor product associativity
- Super-quantum theories (PR boxes): permit signaling under composition

Complex quantum mechanics is the unique survivor.

## 5. Philosophical Payoffs

### 5.1 The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics

Wigner (1960) famously puzzled over "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences." Why should abstract mathematical structures, developed for their own sake, prove so useful in describing physical reality?

LRT offers a partial explanation: **mathematics articulates logical structure, and physical reality instantiates logical structure**.

The effectiveness is not unreasonable but expected. If 3FLL are constitutive of distinguishability, and mathematics is the systematic exploration of logical structure, then mathematics will necessarily be applicable to physics. The "miracle" dissolves.

### 5.2 Quantum Logic and Dialetheism

Birkhoff and von Neumann's quantum logic and contemporary dialetheism both challenge classical logic. Do they refute logic realism?

**Quantum logic:** Describes the non-distributive structure of quantum propositions. This is *compatible* with LRT: IIS has non-Boolean structure for compound propositions while individual states satisfy 3FLL. Quantum logic governs propositions *about* unmeasured states; 3FLL govern measurement outcomes.

**Dialetheism:** Claims some contradictions are true. LRT's response: physical reality has never instantiated a true contradiction at the outcome level. Dialetheism may be defensible for semantic paradoxes or logical puzzles, but it finds no support in physics.

### 5.3 The Measurement Problem Resolved

The measurement problem asks: how does superposition become definite outcome? Standard responses:

- Copenhagen: stipulates collapse, refuses further explanation
- Many-Worlds: denies collapse, multiplies worlds
- Bohmian: adds hidden variables
- GRW: adds stochastic collapse mechanism

LRT reframes the problem: **measurement is the interface between non-Boolean IIS and Boolean actuality**.

The "mystery" of definite outcomes is inverted. What would be mysterious is if outcomes were *not* definite—for then 3FLL would fail, and distinguishability itself would be incoherent. Definite outcomes are not explained by adding mechanisms but by recognizing the constitutive role of logic.

### 5.4 A New Form of Structural Realism

LRT supports a distinctive form of structural realism—call it **logico-physical structuralism**:

- The fundamental level is neither physical stuff nor abstract objects
- It is the structure of distinguishability, constituted by 3FLL
- This structure is simultaneously logical and physical
- Quantum mechanics describes how this structure interfaces with Boolean actuality

This position avoids both:
- Naive realism (positing unobservable entities)
- Instrumentalism (denying reality beyond observations)

What is real is structure—specifically, the distinguishability structure that makes measurement possible.

## 6. Technical Derivations: A Preview

### 6.1 The Derivation Chain

The technical companion paper (Longmire, this volume) establishes:

$$\text{3FLL} \xrightarrow{\text{constitute}} D \xrightarrow{\text{Hardy}} \langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{LRT}\to\text{MM}} \text{MM1-MM5} \xrightarrow{\text{MM 2011}} \mathbb{C}\text{-QM}$$

Where:
- D = distinguishability metric
- ⟨·|·⟩ = complex inner product
- MM1-MM5 = Masanes-Müller reconstruction axioms
- ℂ-QM = complex quantum mechanics

### 6.2 Key Results

| Result | Method | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Inner product from D** | Hardy kernel construction | Proven (§3.3 of technical paper) |
| **LRT → MM1-MM4** | Direct mapping | Proven (Theorem 4.1) |
| **LRT → MM5** | Lee-Selby via CBP | Proven (Theorem 6.2) |
| **Uniqueness** | Stability selection | Proven (Theorem 5.7) |
| **Complex field** | Local tomography + stability | Proven + experimentally confirmed |

### 6.3 The Inner Product Construction

The distinguishability metric D induces inner product structure directly:

**Definition (Hardy Kernel):** For pairwise perfectly distinguishable states x, y, z:

$$K(x,y;z) := 1 - \frac{1}{2}[D(x,y) + D(x,z) - D(y,z)]$$

This kernel satisfies the axioms of an abstract inner product over ℝ, extends to ℂ via continuity and richness of IIS, and uniquely determines complex Hilbert space structure.

The construction is non-circular: it does not presuppose the Born rule, Bloch sphere, or any quantum structure. It derives them from distinguishability alone.

### 6.4 The MM5 Closure

The Masanes-Müller reconstruction (2011) derives quantum mechanics from five axioms. LRT implies four directly. The fifth (MM5: entanglement connectivity) appeared to be an independent physical axiom.

Recent work by Lee and Selby (2020) closes this gap: LRT's Consistency Bridging Principle implies purification uniqueness, which implies MM5. The derivation chain is complete.

### 6.5 Confirmed Prediction

LRT + local tomography predicts that quantum amplitudes must be complex (not real or quaternionic). Renou et al. (2021) experimentally distinguished complex from real quantum mechanics, confirming the complex prediction.

This is a genuine predictive success: LRT entailed complex amplitudes before the experiment was performed.

## 7. Comparison with Rivals

### 7.1 Comparison Table

| Theory | Logic Status | QM Derived? | Measurement | Parsimony | Falsifiable? |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Copenhagen | Epistemic | No | Primitive | Medium | Weak |
| Many-Worlds | Ignored | No | Branching | Low (many worlds) | Weak |
| Bohmian | Ignored | No | Effective | Low (added ontology) | Weak |
| GRW | Ignored | No | Stochastic | Low (parameters) | Yes |
| QBism | Epistemic | No | Belief update | High | No |
| **LRT** | Constitutive | Yes | Actualization | High | Yes |

### 7.2 LRT vs. Copenhagen

Copenhagen treats the Born rule and measurement postulates as primitive stipulations. LRT derives them from the interface structure. Copenhagen refuses to say what the wavefunction represents; LRT identifies it as the IIS distinguishability structure.

**Advantage:** LRT explains what Copenhagen stipulates.

### 7.3 LRT vs. Many-Worlds

Many-Worlds eliminates collapse by postulating that all branches are real. This faces the preferred basis problem (why these branches?) and the probability problem (why the Born rule?).

LRT answers both: the basis is determined by measurement context (Boolean resolution), and the Born rule follows from Gleason's theorem given interface structure.

**Advantage:** LRT solves MWI's open problems without multiplying worlds.

### 7.4 LRT vs. Bohmian Mechanics

Bohmian mechanics adds particle positions and a guiding equation. This is surplus ontology from LRT's perspective: the positions are not needed to explain the interface between IIS and Boolean actuality.

**Advantage:** LRT is more parsimonious.

### 7.5 LRT vs. Objective Collapse (GRW)

GRW adds a stochastic collapse mechanism with free parameters (collapse rate, localization width). LRT predicts that if objective collapse occurs, parameters must be derivable from fundamental constants (Global Parsimony).

**Advantage:** LRT constrains collapse theories; GRW is unconstrained.

### 7.6 LRT vs. QBism

QBism treats quantum states as encoding agent beliefs. This faces the convergence problem: why do rational agents converge on quantum probability assignments?

LRT answers: because the Born rule is the unique probability measure compatible with the interface structure. Convergence is structural necessity, not lucky coincidence.

**Advantage:** LRT explains what QBism leaves mysterious.

## 8. Objections and Replies

### 8.1 "Logic Cannot Constrain Physics"

**Objection:** Logic governs inference, not the physical world. You cannot derive substantive physics from formal logic.

**Reply:** LRT does not derive physics from logic alone. The derivation requires physical axioms (continuity, local tomography, information preservation). What LRT shows is that *given* minimal physical constraints, the logical structure of distinguishability uniquely determines quantum mechanics.

The claim is not "logic entails QM" but "3FLL + minimal physics entails QM."

### 8.2 "This Is Idealism"

**Objection:** Making logic constitutive of reality sounds like idealism: mind-dependent reality.

**Reply:** LRT is not idealist. The distinguishability structure is *objective*—it does not depend on any particular mind. What LRT claims is that distinguishability (an objective relation) presupposes logical structure. This is structural realism, not idealism.

### 8.3 "3FLL Are Revisable"

**Objection:** Non-classical logics (quantum logic, paraconsistent logic) show that 3FLL can be revised. So they cannot be constitutive.

**Reply:** LRT requires 3FLL at the level of measurement outcomes, not at the level of quantum propositions. No experiment has ever yielded an outcome violating 3FLL. Quantum logic describes unmeasured states; 3FLL describe outcomes. These are compatible.

### 8.4 "The Interface Is Ad Hoc"

**Objection:** "Interface" is just a relabeling of "measurement" or "collapse." This is verbal substitution, not explanation.

**Reply:** The interface is not ad hoc; it is *derived*. Given non-Boolean IIS and Boolean actuality, a mediating structure is necessary. The technical paper proves that complex QM is the unique such structure. This is explanation, not relabeling.

### 8.5 "What About Pre-Measurement Reality?"

**Objection:** Before measurement, is there anything real? LRT seems to make reality measurement-dependent.

**Reply:** LRT distinguishes two senses of "real":
1. **IIS-real:** The distinguishability structure exists (modally) prior to measurement
2. **Actualized-real:** Determinate Boolean outcomes exist upon measurement

The wavefunction describes IIS-structure, which is objectively real in sense (1). Measurement actualizes one among several IIS-real possibilities.

### 8.6 "This Is Just Reconstruction"

**Objection:** Reconstruction theorems already derive QM from operational axioms. LRT adds nothing new.

**Reply:** Reconstruction theorems derive QM structure but do not explain *why* the axioms hold. LRT provides the explanation: the reconstruction axioms follow from 3FLL-constituted distinguishability. LRT is philosophically foundational where reconstruction is technically foundational.

---

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1 Summary

Logic Realism Theory proposes that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic are constitutive conditions for physical distinguishability. This thesis is supported by abductive inference from the universal conformity of measurement outcomes to logical structure.

Given 3FLL-constituted distinguishability, the Infinite Information Space emerges as the totality of distinguishable configurations. This space has non-Boolean structure. Boolean actuality—the realm of determinate measurement outcomes—requires a mediating interface. Quantum mechanics is that interface, uniquely determined by stability and consistency constraints.

The technical derivation chain is complete: 3FLL → distinguishability → inner product → Masanes-Müller axioms → complex quantum mechanics.

### 9.2 What LRT Achieves

1. **Unification:** 17 quantum phenomena explained by single principle
2. **Derivation:** Born rule, Hilbert space, unitarity derived rather than postulated
3. **Explanation:** Measurement problem resolved by interface necessity
4. **Prediction:** Complex QM confirmed; information preservation, derivable collapse parameters testable
5. **Parsimony:** No added ontology beyond distinguishability structure

### 9.3 What LRT Does Not Achieve

- Derivation of specific physical constants
- Full QFT extension (open problem)
- Consensus among physicists (this requires time)

### 9.4 The Broader Significance

LRT bridges philosophy and physics in a novel way. It shows that the deepest questions about quantum mechanics—Why this structure? Why these laws?—may have answers rooted in the logical structure of distinguishability itself.

If LRT is correct, physics does not merely respect logic as a constraint on discourse. Physics *instantiates* logic as the structure of distinguishability. The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics becomes reasonable. The measurement problem dissolves. And the boundary between philosophy and physics becomes a bridge.
