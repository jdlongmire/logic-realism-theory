# Archived Prediction Development Documents

**Purpose**: Historical documents from earlier sessions, preserved for continuity

---

## Contents

### Session 2.5 (October 2024)

**Section_4_Revisions_Session_2.5.md**
- Early revisions to main paper Section 4 (Mathematical Formalization)
- Iterative development of K-threshold framework
- Superseded by current `Logic_Realism_Theory_Main.md` Section 4

---

## Why Archived

These documents represent intermediate development stages that have been:
- **Superseded** by later, more refined versions
- **Integrated** into main theory documents
- **Replaced** by better approaches

**Preserved because**:
- Show evolution of thinking
- Document false starts and corrections
- Provide context for current framework
- Maintain research continuity

---

## Not Deleted Because

Academic integrity requires preserving the development history, including:
- Iterations and refinements
- Abandoned approaches
- Lessons learned from dead ends

**Archiving ≠ Deletion**: These documents inform future work even if no longer active.

---

## Archive Policy

**Documents moved to Archive/** when:
1. Superseded by newer versions in main theory
2. Approach abandoned in favor of better alternative
3. Integrated into other documents (content preserved elsewhere)
4. Historical value only (not current development)

**Documents stay in active folders** when:
1. Still informing current work
2. Referenced in protocols or papers
3. Part of active development
4. Needed for reproducibility
