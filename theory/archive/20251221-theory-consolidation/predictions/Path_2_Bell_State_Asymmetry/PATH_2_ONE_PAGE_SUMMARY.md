## The Opportunity

We've identified a **novel quantum measurement prediction** that can be tested on existing quantum hardware (IBM Quantum, IonQ) in **1-2 months** with **high signal-to-noise ratio** (12σ). This is a publishable result (Physical Review Letters quality) that requires minimal resources.

---

## What We're Testing

**The Prediction**: Two types of entangled quantum states (Bell states) should decay at different rates when measured on a quantum computer.

- **Current quantum mechanics**: No difference expected (ΔT2/T1 = 0)
- **Our theory (Logic Realism Theory)**: ~20% difference expected (ΔT2/T1 ≈ 0.19)

**Why This Matters**: If we observe the predicted asymmetry, it provides experimental evidence for a new theoretical framework that derives quantum mechanics from fundamental logical principles.

---

## Experimental Plan

**3-Point Measurement Design**:

1. **Baseline** (IBM Quantum): Measure decoherence for two Bell states
   - Resource ask: ~8,000 circuit shots (~2 hours)
   - Expected result: ΔT2/T1 ≈ 0.19 vs QM prediction of 0.00

2. **Validation** (IonQ): Replicate on different platform
   - Cross-platform verification rules out IBM-specific artifacts
   - Different physics (trapped ions vs superconducting) tests universality

3. **Null Test**: Control measurement with non-entangled states
   - Should show no asymmetry (ΔT2/T1 ≈ 0)
   - Rules out systematic measurement errors

**Decision Tree**: Clear GO/NO-GO criteria after baseline measurement determines whether to proceed to full study or pivot to alternative tests.

## Why This Experiment Is Attractive

**Fast Timeline**: 1-2 months from platform access to results (not years)

**High Confidence**: 12σ signal-to-noise ratio (one of the strongest predictions in our framework)

**Low Risk**: Uses existing hardware, no custom equipment needed

**Clear Outcome**: Three possible results, all publishable:
- ✅ **Confirms prediction**: Major result (PRL/Nature Physics)
- ⚠️ **Partial signal**: Refine theory, valuable for model development
- ❌ **Null result**: Rules out this mechanism, informs theory revision

**Minimal Resources**:
- IBM Quantum access (Premium or collaboration)
- Standard 2-qubit measurements (no exotic gates)
- Analysis uses existing software (Qiskit, QuTiP)

## What We Have Ready

✅ **Computational validation**: Jupyter notebook with first-principles derivation (executed, 0 errors)

✅ **Experimental protocol**: Detailed 3-point measurement plan with decision tree

✅ **Figures**: Publication-quality visualizations (variational framework, QuTiP simulations)

✅ **Analysis pipeline**: Python code for T1/T2 extraction and error propagation

## What We Need

**Platform Access**:
- IBM Quantum: Premium tier OR academic collaboration
- IonQ: AWS Braket/Azure Quantum access (for validation)

**Qubit Requirements**:
- T1 > 100 μs, T2 > 50 μs
- 2-qubit gate fidelity > 99%
- Direct coupling (avoid SWAP gates)

**Collaboration Model**:
- **Option A**: Co-authorship on PRL submission (shared credit)
- **Option B**: Service collaboration (we provide analysis, you provide platform access)
- **Option C**: Grant application partnership (NSF, DOE quantum programs)
