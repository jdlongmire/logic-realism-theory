  conflicts_of_interest: |
    The PI is the developer of Logic Realism Theory and has a vested interest in supporting
    the theory. To mitigate bias: (1) blind analysis with masked noise labels, (2) pre-committed
    analysis code, (3) independent review of results.

# RESEARCH QUESTION AND HYPOTHESIS
# ============================================================================

research_question:
  primary_question: |
    Does the maximum CHSH violation in a Bell test, when extrapolated to the zero-environmental-noise
    limit, equal the Tsirelson bound (standard QM) or fall below it (Logic Realism Theory)?

  theoretical_background: |
    Standard quantum mechanics predicts that the maximum CHSH violation is S_max = 2√2 ≈ 2.828
    (Tsirelson bound), derived from the structure of quantum correlations.

    Logic Realism Theory (LRT) predicts that measurement carries intrinsic logical cost due to
    enforcement of the Law of Excluded Middle. This results in a ceiling below Tsirelson:

    S_LRT^max = 2√2 × (1 - α·η²) ≈ 2.711 ± 0.010

    where α = 3/4 (geometric factor) and η ≈ 0.235 (EM coupling strength).

hypotheses:
  primary_hypothesis:
    label: "H1 (LRT)"
    statement: |
      The zero-environmental-noise CHSH maximum is S₀ = 2.711 ± 0.010,
      which is 0.117 (4.1%) below the Tsirelson bound.
    prediction_type: "Point estimate with uncertainty"

  null_hypothesis:
    label: "H0 (Standard QM)"
    statement: |
      The zero-environmental-noise CHSH maximum equals the Tsirelson bound:
      S₀ = 2√2 ≈ 2.828.
    prediction_type: "Established theoretical value"

  alternative_outcomes:
    - description: "S₀ > 2.83 (above Tsirelson)"
      interpretation: "Experimental error (impossible in both QM and LRT)"
    - description: "S₀ < 2.60 (far below LRT)"
      interpretation: "Unexpected decoherence mechanism"

# ============================================================================
# EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
# ============================================================================

experimental_design:
  platform:
    primary: "IonQ Aria"
    alternative: "Quantinuum H2"
    justification: |
      IonQ Aria provides 99.8% gate fidelity and 99.7% measurement fidelity,
      sufficient to detect the 4.1% LRT signal. Quantinuum H2 (99.9% fidelity)
      is an alternative if higher precision is needed.

    implementation: |
      Insert identity gates with calibrated idle times to induce T1/T2 decay.
      Idle time calculated from: t = -T_eff × ln(1-p), where T_eff = (T1+T2)/2.

    total_correlations: 4

    total_shots: 200000

    justification: |
      Statistical uncertainty per correlation: δE = 2/√N ≈ 0.02 (N=10,000)
      CHSH uncertainty (4 correlations): δS ≈ 2/√N = 0.02
      Signal (QM vs LRT): Δ = 0.117
      Significance (comparing two measurements): Δ/(√2 × δS) ≈ 0.117/0.0283 ≈ 4.1σ

      With 5 noise levels for extrapolation, zero-noise uncertainty: δS₀ ≈ 0.02
      Significance at zero-noise: 0.117/0.02 ≈ 5.6σ (accounting for systematics)

    circuit_order: "Randomized (20 circuits: 5 noise × 4 correlations)"
    shot_order: "Interleaved (not 10K consecutive shots per circuit)"

  blinding:
    method: "Noise level labels masked during data collection and analysis"
    unblinding_trigger: "After analysis code execution and results documentation complete"
    purpose: "Prevent experimenter bias in data interpretation"

      1. Calculate E(a,b) for each noise level: E = (N_00 + N_11 - N_01 - N_10)/N
