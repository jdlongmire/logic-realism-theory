## Abstract

We examine Logic Realism Theory's interpretation of the Tsirelson bound (CHSH ≤ 2√2) as a structural consequence of the Infinite Information Space (IIS)–Boolean actuality interface. LRT proposes that superquantum correlations would destabilize the interface by permitting surplus ontological structure forbidden by Global Parsimony. For standard CHSH tests, this is an *interpretive* contribution: the bound emerges from complex Hilbert space structure, and all approaches predict S ≤ 2√2 exactly. Current experiments (S = 2.73 ± 0.02, Weihs 1998) approach but never exceed the bound. However, recent work on temporal analogs (Leggett-Garg inequalities) and indefinite causal order (Liu & Chiribella 2025) provides potential testing grounds: beyond-bound violations occur only with superposed dynamics, consistent with LRT's claim that definite actualization enforces the bound. We propose that if decoherence "locks in" the bound even for systems previously violating it via superposed dynamics, this would provide an LRT-specific prediction. The paper assesses what LRT adds to the explanatory landscape, identifies hard data from 2024-2025 developments, and distinguishes interpretive from derivational contributions.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Tsirelson Bound

The CHSH inequality bounds classical correlations:

$$S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')| \leq 2$$

Quantum mechanics violates this bound, but only up to:

$$S_{QM} \leq 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$$

This is the **Tsirelson bound** (Cirel'son 1980). The no-signaling algebraic maximum is 4, achievable by hypothetical Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes.

**The foundational question:** Why does nature stop at 2√2, rather than permitting stronger non-signaling correlations?

### 1.2 Existing Explanations

Several approaches derive or explain the Tsirelson bound:

| Approach | Key Principle | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Information Causality** (Pawłowski 2009) | Bob's info access ≤ bits received | Derives bound without Hilbert space |
| **Macroscopic Locality** | Classical limit consistency | Partial derivation |
| **Conservation per NPRF** | Angular momentum conservation | Spacetime constraint |
| **Local Tomography + Continuity** | Selects complex Hilbert space | Mathematical consequence |
| **Trivial Communication Complexity** | No computational speedup | Alternative principle |

Each has been criticized: Information Causality's foundational motivation is considered insufficient; local tomography assumes compositional structure; conservation per NPRF is a physical postulate.

### 1.3 The LRT Proposal

LRT proposes that the Tsirelson bound reflects **interface stability**—the constraint that the IIS-to-Boolean actualization process remain logically consistent under composition.

**Scope of this paper:** We assess what LRT contributes to understanding the bound, identify what hard data exists, and provide an honest assessment of LRT's explanatory vs. derivational power.

## 2. Experimental Data

### 2.1 High-Precision Bell Tests

| Experiment | Year | S Value | Precision | Notes |
|------------|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Aspect et al. | 1982 | 2.70 ± 0.05 | 14σ from classical | First strong violation |
| Weihs et al. | 1998 | 2.73 ± 0.02 | 30σ from classical | Best precision, locality loophole closed |
| Hensen et al. (Delft) | 2015 | 2.38 ± 0.14 | Loophole-free | First loophole-free |
| Giustina et al. (Vienna) | 2015 | ~2.4 | Loophole-free | Photonic |
| Shalm et al. (Boulder) | 2015 | ~2.4 | Loophole-free | Photonic |
| Storz et al. (ETH) | 2023 | ~2.6 | Loophole-free, SC | Superconducting qubits |

**Key observations:**
- Best precision measurement: S = 2.73 ± 0.02 (Weihs 1998)
- Loophole-free measurements: S ~ 2.38-2.6 (lower due to experimental imperfections)
- Tsirelson bound: 2√2 ≈ 2.828
- **No violation of Tsirelson bound has ever been observed**

### 2.2 Why Experiments Don't Saturate the Bound

The gap between measured S and 2√2 reflects:
- Detector inefficiencies
- Imperfect state preparation
- Decoherence and noise
- Non-ideal measurement settings

This is NOT evidence for sub-Tsirelson physics—it's experimental limitation. Quantum mechanics predicts S = 2√2 for ideal measurements on maximally entangled states.

### 2.3 Tests for Beyond-Quantum Correlations

**No experiment has found S > 2√2.** Any such finding would revolutionize physics.

**Current precision limits:** To test whether S could exceed 2√2 by amount ε requires:
- Precision δS < ε
- Currently: δS ~ 10⁻² (best case)
- Ruling out ε = 10⁻³ would require ~10⁴ high-fidelity measurements

**Status:** No experiment has been designed specifically to test whether superquantum correlations exist. All experiments assume QM as correct.

## 3. The LRT Interpretation

### 3.1 Interface Stability Argument

In LRT, entanglement represents global constraints in non-Boolean IIS, actualized locally into Boolean outcomes. The interface must satisfy:

1. **Local Tomography** — Global states determined uniquely from local measurements
2. **No-Signaling** — Preserves locality of actualization
3. **Global Parsimony** — No surplus ontological structure
4. **Consistency Bridging Principle** — Information preservation across category transition

### 3.2 Why Superquantum Correlations Would Be Problematic

LRT proposes that correlations exceeding 2√2 would introduce instability:

**Signaling equivalence:** PR-boxes enable communication protocols exceeding quantum limits. Under composition, this creates functional signaling that the interface cannot mediate consistently.

**Ontological surplus:** Multiple distinct global configurations yield identical local marginals. This violates Global Parsimony—surplus structure exists with no distinguishable consequences.

**Constraint overload:** Excessive correlation strength propagates constraints faster than local actualization can resolve, risking logical contradictions in the actualized (Boolean) domain.

### 3.3 The Role of Complex Hilbert Space

LRT, via local tomography, selects complex Hilbert space as the unique structure satisfying compositional constraints. The Tsirelson bound is then a mathematical consequence:

**Derivation chain:**
```
3FLL → Distinguishability → Local Tomography → Complex Hilbert Space → 2√2
```

The bound emerges from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on quantum observables:
$$S = \langle A_0 B_0 \rangle + \langle A_0 B_1 \rangle + \langle A_1 B_0 \rangle - \langle A_1 B_1 \rangle$$

For ±1-valued observables in Hilbert space, this is bounded by 2√2.

## 4. Honest Assessment: What LRT Provides

### 4.1 What LRT Derives

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Complex Hilbert space | Derived (via local tomography) | From Hardy/Masanes-Müller reconstruction |
| Tsirelson bound value | Consequence | Mathematical result of Hilbert space |
| No-signaling | Derived | From interface locality |

### 4.2 What LRT Does NOT Derive

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Independent derivation of 2√2 | **Not provided** | Bound comes from Hilbert space structure |
| Prediction different from QM | **None** | Same S ≤ 2√2 as standard QM |
| Quantitative test vs. other interpretations | **None** | All predict exactly 2√2 |

### 4.3 Comparison with Information Causality

| Aspect | LRT | Information Causality |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Derives bound without Hilbert space | No | **Yes** |
| Provides physical motivation | Interface stability | Information access limit |
| Applies to general theories | Via parsimony | Operational, theory-independent |
| Foundational status | Claimed fundamental | "Not sufficiently motivated" (critics) |

**Critical point:** Information Causality derives the Tsirelson bound *without* assuming Hilbert space structure. LRT's derivation chain goes through Hilbert space, making it less fundamental in this specific sense.

### 4.4 The Interpretive Contribution

LRT's contribution is primarily **interpretive**:

- **Standard QM:** The bound is 2√2 because that's what the math gives.
- **Information Causality:** The bound is 2√2 because stronger correlations allow superluminal information access under composition.
- **LRT:** The bound is 2√2 because stronger correlations would destabilize the IIS-Boolean interface, violating Global Parsimony.

All three make the same prediction. The difference is explanatory framing, not empirical content.

## 5. Temporal and Causal Order Analogs (2024-2025)

Recent developments extend Tsirelson-like bounds to new domains. These provide potential testing grounds for LRT's interface stability interpretation.

### 5.1 The Temporal Tsirelson Bound (TTB)

The **Leggett-Garg inequality** tests macrorealism via temporal correlations:

$$K_3 = C_{12} + C_{23} - C_{13} \leq 1$$

where $C_{ij}$ are two-time correlations. Quantum mechanics violates this, but only up to the **temporal Tsirelson bound (TTB)**, also called the Lüders bound:

$$K_3^{QM} \leq 1.5$$

This is analogous to the CHSH case: the algebraic maximum is 3, but quantum mechanics stops at 1.5.

### 5.2 Beyond-TTB Violations via Superposed Dynamics

**Chatterjee et al. (2024)** demonstrated that the temporal Tsirelson bound can be **exceeded** when a system evolves under a superposition of unitaries.

**Key result:** When a qubit evolves under a superposition of different unitary operations (controlled by an ancilla), the Leggett-Garg violation can exceed 1.5, growing monotonically with increasing superposition.

**Experimental verification:** Realized in NMR systems. The violation persisted and showed improved robustness against decoherence.

**Critical distinction:**
- Standard (definite-order) dynamics: K₃ ≤ 1.5 (TTB)
- Superposed (indefinite-order) dynamics: K₃ can exceed 1.5

This is NOT a violation of quantum mechanics—it's a consequence of indefinite causal structure within quantum mechanics.

### 5.3 Indefinite Causal Order Bounds

**Liu & Chiribella (Nature Communications, 2025)** established Tsirelson-like bounds for correlations in processes with indefinite causal order.

**Key findings:**

| Quantity | Classical (causal) | Quantum ICO | Algebraic Max |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Correlation set | Inner square | Circle | Outer square |
| OCB inequality | ≤ B_classical | ≤ B_quantum | B_max |

The geometric picture exactly mirrors CHSH: quantum correlations (with indefinite causal order) form a circle between the classical square and the algebraic maximum.

**Implications:**
- Quantum mechanics respects Tsirelson-like bounds even for indefinite causal order
- The maximum quantum violation is smaller than the algebraic maximum
- Physical principles beyond quantum mechanics would be needed for stronger violations

### 5.4 LRT Interpretation of Analogs

The temporal and causal-order extensions suggest a refinement of LRT's interface stability picture:

**Standard CHSH (spatial, definite order):**
- Interface: IIS → Boolean actualization at spacelike-separated sites
- Constraint: No surplus ontological structure under composition
- Bound: 2√2 (stable interface)

**Temporal correlations (Leggett-Garg):**
- Interface: IIS → Boolean actualization at different times
- Under definite dynamics: TTB = 1.5 (stable interface)
- Under superposed dynamics: Interface constraints relaxed → TTB can be exceeded

**LRT's potential claim:** The TTB holds for definite-order dynamics because the interface enforces single-valued actualization at each time. Superposed dynamics create "superposed actualizations" that relax this constraint—the interface becomes indefinite, allowing stronger temporal correlations.

**Testable extension:** If LRT is correct, beyond-TTB violations should only occur when the actualization process itself is superposed. If beyond-TTB violations occur in regimes where LRT predicts definite actualization (e.g., after decoherence), this would challenge the interface stability interpretation.

### 5.5 Current Data on Analogs

| Domain | Bound | Violated? | LRT Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| CHSH (spatial) | 2√2 | Never | Interface stability under composition |
| Leggett-Garg (temporal, definite) | 1.5 | Never | Single-valued temporal actualization |
| Leggett-Garg (temporal, superposed) | 1.5 | **Yes** (Chatterjee 2024) | Superposed actualization relaxes constraint |
| Indefinite causal order | Derived (Liu 2025) | Never | New domain, bounds being established |

**Key observation:** The only "beyond-Tsirelson" violations involve indefinite/superposed dynamics. Standard definite-order processes respect the bounds. This is consistent with LRT's picture: definite actualization enforces the bound; superposed actualization relaxes it.

## 6. Distinguishing Predictions?

### 6.1 What All Approaches Predict (Standard CHSH)

All approaches predict:
- S ≤ 2√2 exactly
- No superquantum correlations
- Standard quantum mechanics

### 6.2 Could LRT Make Distinct Predictions?

LRT's framework *could* make additional predictions if interface stability constrains more than just the Tsirelson bound:

**Potential distinctive claims:**

| Prediction | LRT Claim | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| No superquantum correlations in any scenario | Yes | Same as QM |
| No violations in causal inequality tests | Yes | 2025 experiments consistent |
| Bound holds for macroscopic entanglement | Yes | Same as QM |
| Bound robust under gravitational effects | Unclear | Not tested |

**Honest assessment:** No experiment currently distinguishes LRT's interpretation from standard QM or Information Causality.

### 6.3 The Analog Domain: Where LRT Could Differ

The temporal/causal-order analogs provide potential discriminating tests:

| Scenario | Information Causality | LRT (Interface Stability) |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Standard CHSH | Bound = 2√2 | Bound = 2√2 |
| TTB (definite dynamics) | Bound = 1.5 (implied) | Bound = 1.5 (interface stability) |
| TTB (superposed dynamics) | Unclear status | Bound relaxed (indefinite actualization) |
| Decoherence + temporal test | Bound should hold | Bound MUST hold (definite actualization) |

**LRT-specific prediction:** If a system has decohered (actualization has occurred), temporal correlations cannot exceed the TTB even if the prior dynamics were superposed. Decoherence "locks in" the interface constraint.

**Test:** Prepare superposed-unitary temporal correlations, then apply decoherence before final measurement. If K₃ > 1.5 persists after decoherence, LRT is challenged.

### 6.4 The "Why This Bound" Question

| Approach | Answer to "Why 2√2?" | Satisfying? |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Mathematical (Tsirelson) | Cauchy-Schwarz on Hilbert space | Technically correct but not explanatory |
| Information Causality | Information access constraint | Operational but foundationally unclear |
| Conservation per NPRF | Spacetime symmetry | Physical but assumes QM |
| LRT | Interface stability + Parsimony | Interpretive but not independent |

All answers are partial. The foundational question remains open.

## 7. Falsification Conditions

### 7.1 What Would Falsify LRT's Interpretation?

**LRT interpretation falsified if:**

1. Reliable S > 2√2 observed without signaling (superquantum correlations exist)
2. Bound exceeded in regime where interface should be stable
3. Alternative theories (real or quaternionic QM) reproduce S > 2√2 without parsimony violation

**Note:** These would also falsify standard QM and Information Causality. There is no LRT-specific falsifier for the Tsirelson bound prediction.

### 7.2 What Would Support LRT's Interpretation?

LRT interpretation supported (but not uniquely) if:

1. All experiments saturate but never exceed 2√2
2. Causal inequality bounds consistent with quantum limits
3. No superquantum correlations in any experimental configuration

**Honest assessment:** These outcomes also support QM and Information Causality. Support is shared.

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 The Interpretive vs. Derivational Distinction

LRT's treatment of the Tsirelson bound illustrates a general pattern:

| LRT Contribution | Type |
|-----------------|------|
| Complex Hilbert space selection | Derivational (via reconstruction) |
| Tsirelson bound value | Consequential (from Hilbert space) |
| "Why not higher?" explanation | Interpretive (interface stability) |

LRT does not provide an independent derivation of 2√2 from 3FLL. It provides an interpretation of why the mathematically-derived bound is physically necessary.

### 8.2 How LRT Complements Information Causality

Information Causality (IC) and LRT address different aspects of "why 2√2":

| Aspect | Information Causality | LRT |
|--------|----------------------|-----|
| **Type of explanation** | Operational/information-theoretic | Ontological/structural |
| **Core principle** | Bob's info ≤ bits received | Interface stability |
| **Foundational criticism** | "Not sufficiently motivated" | Relies on Hilbert space |
| **Scope** | Any theory with correlations | Theories satisfying 3FLL |

**Complementarity, not competition:**

IC shows *what* is ruled out (superquantum correlations) via information access. LRT offers *why* this must be: surplus ontological structure (parsimony violation) at the IIS-Boolean interface.

Neither is complete alone:
- IC lacks deeper physical/ontological motivation
- LRT lacks theory-independent derivation

Together they provide operational (IC) + ontological (LRT) constraints on the same bound.

### 8.3 Relation to Other LRT Predictions

The Tsirelson bound interpretation differs from other LRT predictions:

| Prediction | LRT-Specific? | Experimentally Distinguishable? |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Collapse rate formula | Yes (no free parameters) | Yes (vs. GRW) |
| No anomalous heating | Yes (logical actualization) | Yes (vs. physical collapse) |
| Frame-independence | Shared with MWI | Partially (vs. Bohmian) |
| Tsirelson bound | Shared with all | **No** |

The Tsirelson bound is LRT's **weakest** distinctive prediction because all quantum interpretations share it.

### 8.4 The Value of Interpretive Contributions

Even without distinct predictions, interpretive contributions have value:

1. **Explanatory unification:** Connects the bound to Global Parsimony and interface stability
2. **Conceptual clarity:** Explains *why* superquantum correlations are impossible, not just that they're excluded
3. **Framework coherence:** Integrates with LRT's other claims (collapse, non-locality)

However, interpretive contributions cannot be experimentally validated directly.

---

## 9. Conclusion

LRT interprets the Tsirelson bound as a structural consequence of interface stability: correlations exceeding 2√2 would introduce surplus ontological structure forbidden by Global Parsimony. This provides a coherent explanation within LRT's framework.

**Key findings:**

1. **Hard data:** No Tsirelson bound violation observed in standard CHSH tests. Best precision: S = 2.73 ± 0.02 (Weihs 1998). Gap from 2√2 reflects experimental imperfection, not physics.

2. **Temporal and causal-order analogs:** Recent work (Chatterjee et al. 2024, Liu & Chiribella 2025) establishes Tsirelson-like bounds in temporal (Leggett-Garg) and indefinite causal order domains. Importantly, beyond-TTB violations occur only with superposed dynamics—consistent with LRT's picture that definite actualization enforces the bound.

3. **LRT's contribution:** Primarily interpretive, but with potential testable extension: decoherence should "lock in" the bound even for systems that previously violated it via superposed dynamics.

4. **Comparison with alternatives:** Information Causality derives the bound without Hilbert space formalism. LRT provides complementary ontological motivation—neither is complete alone.

5. **Distinguishing predictions:** For standard CHSH, none. For temporal analogs with decoherence, potentially testable: LRT predicts beyond-TTB violations cannot persist after actualization.

6. **Value:** LRT provides explanatory unification by connecting the bound to its broader framework (Global Parsimony, interface stability) and extends naturally to new domains (temporal correlations, indefinite causal order).

The Tsirelson bound illustrates both LRT's interpretive scope and its potential for extension: explaining *why* quantum mechanics has certain features while suggesting testable consequences in new experimental regimes.
