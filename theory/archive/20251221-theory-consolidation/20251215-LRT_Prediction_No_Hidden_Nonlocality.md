## Abstract

We derive predictions about quantum non-locality from Logic Realism Theory's treatment of entanglement as constraint satisfaction rather than causal influence. LRT uniquely predicts that there is no hidden non-local mechanism—not even one respecting no-signaling. Entangled correlations arise from pre-existing structure in the Infinite Information Space (IIS), actualized locally at each measurement site. This yields testable predictions: perfect Lorentz invariance of correlations with no preferred frame and complete independence from temporal ordering of spacelike-separated measurements. Existing experiments (Zbinden et al. 2001, Stefanov et al. 2002) have tested quantum correlations with moving detectors at non-relativistic velocities and found no frame-dependent effects, consistent with LRT. However, definitive tests require relativistic velocities (v/c > 0.01), which have not yet been achieved. We assess the current experimental landscape, identify what has and has not been tested, and propose protocols for future tests. We also address the theoretical debate about whether Bohmian mechanics can be formulated in a Lorentz-invariant way, noting that no quantitative predictions for frame-dependent effects exist in the literature.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Non-Locality Problem

Bell's theorem (1964) established that quantum correlations cannot be explained by local hidden variables. The observed violations of Bell inequalities force a choice: abandon locality, abandon realism, or accept some combination of both.

Standard interpretations handle this differently:

| Interpretation | Treatment of Non-Locality |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Copenhagen | Instrumentalist (refuses to commit) |
| Bohmian mechanics | Embraces explicit non-local pilot wave |
| GRW/CSL | Non-local collapse dynamics |
| Many-Worlds | Denies non-locality (local branching) |

Each approach carries interpretive costs: Bohmian mechanics may require a preferred reference frame; collapse models introduce non-local spacetime events; Copenhagen avoids commitment at the cost of explanatory power; Many-Worlds requires accepting universal branching.

### 1.2 The LRT Alternative

Logic Realism Theory offers a distinctive resolution: there is no non-locality at all. What appears as non-local correlation is:

1. **Pre-existing structure** in the Infinite Information Space (non-spatiotemporal)
2. **Local actualization** at each measurement site
3. **Constraint satisfaction** rather than causal influence

The key insight: Bell's theorem rules out local hidden *variables*. LRT does not posit hidden variables—the quantum state provides the complete description of IIS structure. Therefore Bell's theorem does not apply in its standard form.

This paper develops the testable consequences of this claim.

### 1.3 Scope and Structure

**The central claim:** LRT predicts zero hidden non-locality. Entangled correlations arise entirely from constraint satisfaction on pre-existing IIS structure, with no causal mechanism—hidden or otherwise—connecting spacelike-separated measurements.

**Testable consequences:**
- Perfect frame-independence of correlations
- No excess energy cost from entanglement measurements
- No temporal ordering effects
- No preferred direction in momentum space

The paper proceeds as follows: §2 reviews standard treatments of non-locality; §3 develops LRT's constraint satisfaction picture; §4 reviews existing experimental data; §5 presents distinguishing predictions; §6 proposes experimental tests with statistical requirements; §7 discusses limitations, the Bohmian Lorentz-invariance debate, and current status.

## 2. Background: Non-Locality in Quantum Mechanics

### 2.1 The EPR Scenario

Consider the standard entangled state:
$$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

Alice and Bob share this state with spacelike-separated measurements. When Alice measures in basis θ_A at time t_A, standard quantum mechanics predicts:

1. Bob's reduced state changes instantaneously
2. This change occurs faster than light can propagate
3. The resulting correlations violate Bell inequalities

### 2.2 The No-Signaling Constraint

Despite apparent non-locality, the no-signaling theorem prevents faster-than-light communication:

$$P(b|B) = \sum_a P(a,b|A,B) = P(b|B)$$

Bob's marginal statistics are independent of Alice's measurement choice. Non-locality is "hidden" in the sense that it cannot be used for signaling.

### 2.3 Interpretation-Dependent Predictions

Different interpretations make different commitments about the nature of this non-locality:

**Bohmian mechanics:**
- Explicit non-local guidance via pilot wave
- Particle positions are "real" hidden variables
- May require preferred reference frame for Lorentz invariance
- Predicts subtle frame-dependent effects (extremely small)

**GRW/CSL collapse models:**
- Collapse is a physical event at spacetime location
- Non-local correlations arise from simultaneous collapse of entangled pair
- Relativistic formulations remain challenging
- May predict temporal ordering effects

**Copenhagen:**
- Instrumentalist: correlations are predictions, not explanations
- No commitment to underlying mechanism
- Frame-dependence question remains unanswered

**Many-Worlds:**
- No collapse, therefore no non-local event
- Correlations explained by branch structure
- Fully Lorentz invariant by construction
- But requires accepting all branches as equally real

## 3. LRT's Constraint Satisfaction Picture

### 3.1 Entanglement as Non-Factorizable Structure

In LRT, entangled particles are not "two things mysteriously connected." They are one configuration in IIS with non-factorizable structure.

The state |Φ⁺⟩ represents a joint configuration that cannot be decomposed into independent subsystems. This non-factorizability is a structural feature of IIS, not a dynamical connection.

### 3.2 Measurement as Local Actualization

When measurement occurs:

1. The interface criterion (entropy saturation + pointer decoherence) is met locally
2. Boolean outcome is actualized at the measurement site
3. The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) enforce consistency

The correlations are not caused by signaling between particles. They are constraint satisfaction: the joint state already satisfies 3FLL globally. Actualization at one site doesn't cause the outcome at the other—both outcomes are constrained by the same pre-existing structure.

### 3.3 Why This Eliminates Non-Locality

**Standard picture:** Alice's measurement causes change at Bob's location (faster than light, but no-signaling preserves consistency)

**LRT picture:** Neither measurement causes anything at the other's location. Both outcomes are determined by constraint satisfaction on the joint IIS structure, which is non-spatiotemporal.

The distinction:
- **Causal connection:** A → B (even if hidden, even if no-signaling)
- **Constraint satisfaction:** A and B both satisfy C, where C is the IIS structure

Constraint satisfaction is acausal. There is no "influence" traveling between sites because there is no influence at all—only consistency requirements.

### 3.4 The Frame-Independence Claim

Because actualization is not a dynamical process occurring at a spacetime point, but a category transition (IIS → Boolean) occurring when interface criteria are met:

- There is no fact about "which measurement happened first" (for spacelike separation)
- Different reference frames can disagree about temporal ordering
- This disagreement is physically meaningless—there is no "real" sequence of collapses
- Correlations are exactly Lorentz invariant

### 3.5 What "No Action at a Distance" Means

LRT's claim is specific: correlations are not caused by influence (neither local nor non-local). They are structural features of IIS configuration.

**The analogy:** Two people independently solve the same math problem and get the same answer—not because one influenced the other, but because the problem has structural constraints (mathematical truth) that both solutions respect.

When Alice measures and gets "up," Bob's particle doesn't "become" down due to any influence from Alice. Instead:

1. The entangled state is a single IIS configuration with built-in anti-correlation
2. Alice's measurement actualizes one branch (up) from IIS to Boolean
3. Bob's measurement actualizes the correlated branch (down)
4. No influence traveled; both actualizations respect the global constraint

**Testable consequence:** If correlations were caused by influence, that influence would have dynamics (takes energy, may have preferred direction). If correlations are constraint satisfaction, no dynamics are involved (timeless structure).

## 4. Existing Experimental Data

### 4.1 What Has Been Tested

Several experiments have tested quantum correlations in relativistic configurations. The results constrain possible frame-dependent effects.

**Zbinden et al. (2001)** — Phys. Rev. A 63, 022111

- Setup: Entangled photons measured at 10 km separation in Geneva
- Timing precision: < 5 picoseconds
- Moving detectors: Both detectors in relative motion so each is "first" in its own frame
- **Result:** No frame-dependent effects observed
- **Constraint:** "Speed of quantum information" ≥ 0.66 × 10⁷ c (Geneva frame), ≥ 1.5 × 10⁴ c (CMB frame)

**Stefanov et al. (2002)** — Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 120404

- Setup: Moving beam splitters using acousto-optic modulators
- Separation: 55 m
- Test: "Multisimultaneity" model predicts correlations disappear with moving analyzers
- **Result:** Correlations NOT reduced; Multisimultaneity refuted

**Micius satellite (Yin et al., 2017)** — Science 356, 1140

- Setup: Satellite-to-ground entanglement over 1,200 km
- Velocity: ~7.7 km/s orbital speed (v/c ~ 2.6 × 10⁻⁵)
- **Result:** Bell inequality violated with high significance
- **Note:** Velocities too low to probe relativistic effects; tests locality loophole, not frame-dependence

### 4.2 What Has NOT Been Tested

| Test | Status | Challenge |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Bell tests at v/c > 0.01 | **Not performed** | Requires interplanetary platforms |
| Frame-dependence of S parameter | **Not performed** | Current precision insufficient |
| Energy consumption of entanglement | **Not performed** | Conceptually unclear, technically difficult |
| Temporal ordering effects | **Partially tested** | No effects found (Stefanov 2002) |

**Critical gap:** All existing tests are at non-relativistic velocities. The highest velocity tested (satellite) is v/c ~ 10⁻⁵, far below where relativistic effects would appear.

### 4.3 Velocity Regimes and Expected Effects

| Velocity (v/c) | Platform | Bohmian prediction | LRT prediction | Testable? |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| 10⁻⁵ | Earth orbit | ΔS ~ 10⁻¹⁰ | ΔS = 0 | No (below noise) |
| 10⁻⁴ | Lunar distance | ΔS ~ 10⁻⁸ | ΔS = 0 | No |
| 10⁻² | Fast interplanetary | ΔS ~ 10⁻⁴ | ΔS = 0 | Marginal |
| 10⁻¹ | Solar sail / ion drive | ΔS ~ 10⁻² | ΔS = 0 | Yes |

**Note:** Bohmian predictions are illustrative only. No quantitative calculation of ΔS exists in the literature (see Section 6.2 caveat).

---

## 5. Distinguishing Predictions

### 5.1 Perfect Frame-Independence

**Setup:** Relativistic EPR with detectors in different reference frames.

In frame F₁: Alice measures at t_A, Bob at t_B > t_A
In frame F₂: Bob measures at t_B', Alice at t_A' > t_B'
In frame F₃: Simultaneous measurements

**Predictions by interpretation:**

| Interpretation | Frame-Dependence | Preferred Frame | Temporal Ordering Matters |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Bohmian | Tiny v-dependence possible | Yes (absolute time) | Yes |
| GRW | Under investigation | No | Possibly |
| Copenhagen | Unspecified | Unspecified | Unspecified |
| Many-Worlds | None | No | No |
| **LRT** | **None (exact)** | **No** | **No (by construction)** |

**LRT's specific prediction:** Correlations are exactly identical in all inertial frames. No velocity-dependent corrections, no preferred direction, no temporal ordering effects. This is not approximate Lorentz invariance—it is exact by construction.

### 5.2 Energy Cost Test (Speculative)

If hidden non-local mechanisms exist, they may require energy (however small).

**GRW prediction:** Energy cost ΔE ~ ℏλ per collapse event (collapse modifies wavefunction)

**Bohmian prediction:** Potential energy cost from pilot wave guidance (disputed, no calculation exists)

**LRT prediction:** Zero excess energy beyond detector operation. Constraint satisfaction is "free"—it doesn't require work because it's not a dynamical process.

**Proposed test:** Ultra-sensitive calorimetry on entanglement measurements, comparing:
- Energy consumed measuring entangled pairs
- Energy consumed measuring product state pairs
- Difference should be zero (LRT) or non-zero (physical collapse models)

**Honest assessment:** This test is conceptually murky and technically extremely difficult. What would "energy for correlation" even mean physically? No experimental protocol has been developed. Status: **speculative future direction**, not near-term test.

### 5.3 No Temporal Ordering Effects

**Setup:** Delayed-choice experiment with spacelike-separated measurements.

Alice can choose her measurement basis after Bob's photon has been measured in Bob's frame, but before it arrives in Alice's frame.

**Question:** Does Alice's "delayed" choice affect Bob's outcomes?

**Standard QM:** No (no-signaling), but interpretations differ on why

**Bohmian:** Hidden temporal ordering exists; Alice's choice "really" came after Bob's measurement in absolute time

**GRW:** Depends on which collapse happened "first" in some ordering

**LRT prediction:** Temporal ordering is completely irrelevant. Statistics are identical regardless of:
- Which measurement "happens first" in any frame
- Whether choices are delayed or immediate
- Relative velocity of observers

This is because actualization is not an event in spacetime but a category transition.

### 5.4 Model Comparison Table

| Observable | LRT | Bohmian | GRW | Many-Worlds |
|------------|-----|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frame-dependence | None | Possible (tiny) | Possible | None |
| Energy cost | Zero | Unknown | Non-zero | Zero |
| Temporal ordering | Irrelevant | Matters (hidden) | May matter | Irrelevant |
| Preferred frame | None | Possibly | None | None |
| Mechanism | Constraint satisfaction | Pilot wave | Collapse dynamics | Branching |

### 5.5 Falsification Conditions

**LRT is falsified if:**

1. Correlations show velocity-dependent corrections (supports Bohmian)
2. Excess energy consumption detected in entanglement measurements (supports GRW)
3. Temporal ordering effects detected (supports dynamical collapse)
4. Preferred frame discovered (supports Bohmian)

**LRT is supported if:**

1. Correlations exactly Lorentz invariant across velocity range
2. Zero excess energy (within experimental precision)
3. No temporal ordering effects
4. No preferred direction in any experiment

## 6. Proposed Experimental Tests

### 6.1 Frame-Independence Tests

**Protocol:**

1. Create entangled photon pairs in laboratory frame
2. Send photons to detectors in different reference frames (moving platforms, satellites)
3. Vary relative velocities: v = 0, 0.1c, 0.3c (satellite orbits)
4. Measure correlation coefficients in each configuration
5. Test for velocity-dependent deviations

**Current status:** Not yet performed at significant velocities. Requires:
- Satellite-based entanglement distribution
- Precise timing across reference frames
- High-fidelity correlation measurements

**Timeline:** 10-20 years for definitive tests

### 6.2 Temporal Ordering Tests

**Protocol:**

1. Create entangled pairs with variable path lengths
2. Implement delayed choice for one measurement
3. Vary timing to probe different "orderings" across frames
4. Test whether statistics depend on timing configuration

**LRT prediction:** Statistics identical regardless of timing
**Bohmian prediction:** Hidden ordering effects (extremely small)

**Current status:** Partially performed. No ordering effects observed, consistent with LRT. More precise tests needed.

**Timeline:** 5-10 years for higher precision

### 6.3 Experimental Platform Summary

| Platform | Tests Frame-Independence | Tests Energy | Tests Ordering | Timeline |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Satellite QKD | Yes (orbital velocities) | No | Yes | 10-20 years |
| Ground-based interferometry | Limited | Yes | Yes | 5-10 years |
| Ion trap systems | No | Yes | Yes | 5 years |
| Photonic systems | Limited | Limited | Yes | Current |

### 6.4 Statistical Requirements

**Question:** How many Bell measurements are needed to detect frame-dependent effects?

**Setup:** Measure Bell-CHSH parameter S in two frames with relative velocity v.

**Expected signal (if Bohmian preferred-frame effects exist):**
- Predicted: ΔS ~ (v/c)² × α, where α is unknown (no literature value)
- At v/c = 0.1: ΔS ~ 10⁻² × α

**Current measurement precision:**
- Best Bell tests achieve: δS ~ 10⁻³ per campaign
- Single-shot uncertainty: δS ~ 0.1

**Required measurements:**

To detect ΔS = 10⁻² at 5σ significance:
$$N = \left(\frac{5\sigma}{\text{SNR}}\right)^2 \approx 2500$$

Need ~2500 high-quality Bell measurements per frame.

**Feasibility assessment:**

| Requirement | Current Capability | Gap |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| Measurement rate | ~100/hour | Adequate |
| Velocity | v/c ~ 10⁻⁵ (orbit) | **Need v/c ~ 0.1** |
| Precision δS | ~10⁻³ | Adequate |
| Platform | Earth-based / LEO | **Need deep space** |

**Conclusion:** The statistical requirements are achievable. The **velocity requirement** is the critical gap—requires interplanetary platform.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Relation to Bell's Theorem

Bell's theorem establishes: Local hidden variable theories cannot reproduce quantum correlations.

LRT response: LRT does not have hidden variables. The quantum state is the complete description of IIS structure. Bell's theorem rules out:

$$P(a,b|A,B) = \int d\lambda \rho(\lambda) P(a|A,\lambda) P(b|B,\lambda)$$

LRT does not claim this form. The joint probability arises from constraint satisfaction on non-factorizable IIS structure, not from integration over hidden variables.

### 7.2 Caveat: Bohmian Lorentz-Invariant Formulations

**Critical honesty:** The prediction that Bohmian mechanics shows frame-dependent effects is disputed.

**Standard Bohmian mechanics (non-relativistic):**
- Requires absolute simultaneity (preferred frame) for pilot wave guidance
- Multi-particle systems need a foliation of spacetime into simultaneity surfaces

**Relativistic extensions exist:**

| Formulation | Authors | Claim |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Covariant foliation | Dürr et al. (2014) | Foliation extracted from ψ; "fundamentally Lorentz invariant" |
| Signal-locality | Valentini (2008) | No superluminal signaling possible |
| Flash ontology | Tumulka (2006) | Relativistic GRW-type collapse |

**The debate:**
- Dürr, Goldstein, Zanghì (2014): "The required foliation could be covariantly determined by the wave function," allowing theories that "seem to qualify as fundamentally Lorentz invariant."
- However: "It is not at all clear what, exactly, fundamental/serious compatibility with relativity does, or should, require."
- Chen (2024): "Bohmian Mechanics posits a deterministic quantum framework where particle trajectories are guided by a wave function within a preferred Lorentz frame."

**What the literature provides:**
- ✓ Theoretical arguments for and against Lorentz invariance of Bohmian mechanics
- ✗ **No quantitative predictions** for frame-dependent effects
- ✗ **No experimental proposals** with specific detection thresholds

**Honest assessment:**

If Bohmian mechanics can achieve exact Lorentz invariance, it becomes empirically indistinguishable from LRT in frame-dependence tests. The distinction would be philosophical (guidance vs. constraints) rather than experimental.

The tests proposed in this paper would then discriminate:
- LRT/Lorentz-invariant-Bohmian vs. Standard-Bohmian (preferred frame)
- Not LRT vs. Bohmian (if Bohmian is Lorentz-invariant)

### 7.3 Relation to No-Signaling

No-signaling is automatically satisfied in LRT because:

1. Actualization is local (occurs at measurement site)
2. Correlations are not causal (constraint satisfaction)
3. No mechanism exists to exploit for signaling

The no-signaling theorem becomes trivial rather than constraining: there is nothing to signal with because there is no non-local mechanism.

### 7.4 Comparison with Many-Worlds

Both LRT and Many-Worlds predict perfect frame-independence and no energy cost. The distinction:

| Aspect | LRT | Many-Worlds |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Branching | No (single actuality) | Yes (all branches exist) |
| Recoherence | Impossible after actualization | In principle possible |
| Born rule | Derived from Gleason | Problematic (measure problem) |
| Ontology | Boolean outcomes are real | All outcomes equally real |

**Distinguishing test:** Recoherence experiments. LRT predicts impossible after actualization; Many-Worlds allows in principle.

### 7.5 Limitations

1. **Relativistic velocities:** Current experiments limited to low velocities. High-precision tests require satellite infrastructure.

2. **Energy precision:** Detecting zero energy cost requires ruling out all background sources. Challenging but achievable.

3. **Distinguishing from Many-Worlds:** Both predict frame-independence. Distinction requires recoherence tests or other observables.

4. **Interpretation-dependence:** Some predictions (e.g., temporal ordering) may be interpretation-dependent rather than experimentally accessible.

### 7.6 Current Status Assessment

| Prediction | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Frame-independence | Untested at high precision | Requires satellite experiments |
| Zero energy cost | Testable now | Requires precise calorimetry |
| No temporal ordering | Partially confirmed | Higher precision needed |
| No preferred frame | Consistent with data | No evidence of preferred frame |

---

## 8. Conclusion

Logic Realism Theory makes a distinctive prediction about quantum non-locality: there is none. Entangled correlations arise from constraint satisfaction on pre-existing IIS structure, not from causal mechanisms connecting spacelike-separated events.

The testable consequences are:

1. **Perfect frame-independence:** Correlations exactly Lorentz invariant, no velocity-dependent corrections
2. **Zero excess energy:** Entanglement measurements consume no energy beyond detector operation
3. **No temporal ordering:** Statistics independent of measurement sequence in any frame
4. **No preferred frame:** No special direction in momentum space

These predictions distinguish LRT from:
- **Bohmian mechanics:** May show preferred-frame effects
- **GRW/CSL:** May show energy consumption and temporal ordering
- **Copenhagen:** Makes no commitment
- **Many-Worlds:** Similar predictions, distinguished by recoherence

The philosophical payoff is significant: LRT renders quantum non-locality not mysterious but non-existent. The correlations are explained not by "spooky action at a distance" but by the non-spatiotemporal structure of the Infinite Information Space, actualized locally at each measurement site.
