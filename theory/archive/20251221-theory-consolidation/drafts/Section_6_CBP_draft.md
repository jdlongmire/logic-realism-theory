## 6. Constraining IIS Dynamics

The previous section established a fundamental asymmetry: IIS contains non-Boolean structure (superpositions, indeterminate states), while actuality must be Boolean. This raises an immediate question that must be addressed before proceeding: **what constrains transformations on IIS?**

IIS is not static. States evolve, transform, interact. But not every conceivable transformation can be admissible - otherwise the framework would have no physical content. Something must constrain dynamics, and that something cannot be arbitrary physical postulation if we are to maintain the logical foundations developed thus far.

### 6.1 The Architectural Necessity

Consider the structure we have established:

1. **IIS** contains all distinguishable states (constituted by 3FLL)
2. **Actuality** is Boolean (3FLL fully enforced)
3. **Resolution** is the process by which IIS states become actual

The question of dynamics concerns transformations *within* IIS - before resolution to actuality. What principles govern these pre-Boolean transformations?

The answer follows from the structure itself. Any transformation on IIS must preserve the possibility of consistent Boolean resolution. If a transformation produced states that *could never* resolve consistently to Boolean actuality - states that would generate ungroundable propositions, contradictions in actuality, or violations of Excluded Middle - then such states would have no path to the actual world.

But LRT identifies actuality with what can be grounded through the resolution of IIS via 3FLL. States with no path to actuality are, within LRT's ontology, states that cannot exist as anything more than formal possibilities. They are not part of physical reality.

This is not an additional assumption but an architectural requirement. The very structure of the IIS-Actuality relationship demands it.

### 6.2 The Consistency Bridging Principle

We state this requirement explicitly:

**Definition 6.1 (Consistency Bridging Principle).** *Admissible transformations on IIS are only those for which all reachable states can, in principle, participate in a consistent resolution to Boolean actuality, without generating ungroundable propositions.*

Several aspects require clarification:

**"Admissible transformations"** - We are constraining what dynamics are physically possible, not what is mathematically conceivable. Many transformations can be written down that violate CBP; they simply do not correspond to physical processes.

**"All reachable states"** - If transformation T takes state s₁ to s₂, then s₂ must satisfy CBP. The constraint applies to the image of the transformation.

**"In principle participate"** - This is a modal condition. The state need not *actually* resolve in any given physical situation. It must merely be *capable* of consistent resolution. Superpositions satisfy this: they can evolve, interfere, and eventually resolve to definite outcomes.

**"Consistent resolution"** - Resolution that satisfies 3FLL. No contradictory actuality, no undefined truth values, no violations of identity.

**"Ungroundable propositions"** - Propositions that would require truthmakers external to the IIS-Actuality framework. By the Parsimony Theorem (developed in Part III), actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions and nothing more.

### 6.3 What CBP Is Not

To prevent misunderstanding:

**CBP is not a collapse postulate.** It does not specify *when* or *how* resolution occurs. It constrains dynamics, not measurement.

**CBP is not an assertion that "only Boolean states exist."** IIS genuinely contains non-Boolean structure. CBP says this structure must be *compatible with* eventual Boolean resolution, not that it must *already be* Boolean.

**CBP is not circular with Boolean actuality.** It does not say "dynamics must produce actuality" (which would presuppose what we are explaining). It says dynamics must *preserve the possibility* of consistent resolution - a structural constraint, not a temporal requirement.

**CBP is not an empirical hypothesis.** Like the logical laws themselves, CBP is a framework condition. It cannot be tested by looking for transformations that violate it, because such transformations would not correspond to physical processes within LRT. Its justification is architectural, not observational.

### 6.4 Implications

CBP has substantive consequences that will be developed in Part III:

**Reversibility.** Irreversible transformations destroy information - they map multiple input states to the same output state. But information destruction requires a mechanism: something must absorb or erase the lost distinctions. Such a mechanism would constitute structure beyond the constitutive package (3FLL + IIS + s₀). By parsimony principles developed later, no such surplus structure exists at the fundamental level. Irreversible dynamics would produce states whose resolution history becomes unrecoverable - potential violations of consistent grounding. Thus CBP constrains fundamental dynamics to be reversible.

This argument is sketched here but made rigorous in Part III, where the Parsimony Theorem provides the formal grounding.

**Continuity.** Discontinuous dynamics require specification of exception points or jump conditions - additional structure beyond the minimal constitutive package. While this argument is weaker than for reversibility, it motivates the expectation of continuous dynamics.

**Local Tomography.** CBP alone does not constrain composite systems. How global states relate to local measurements requires additional physical input. This is discussed in Part III.

### 6.5 Summary

CBP is not an arbitrary addition to the framework. It is the natural answer to a question that the IIS-Actuality structure itself poses: given that actuality must be Boolean, what constrains transformations in the pre-Boolean space of IIS?

The answer - consistency with eventual Boolean resolution - follows from the architecture. CBP makes this answer explicit. It connects the logical foundations of Part I to the physical constraints of Part II and the mathematical derivations of Part III.

With CBP in place, we have:

| Component | Role | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 3FLL | Constitutes distinguishability; enforces Boolean actuality | Foundational |
| IIS | Space of all distinguishable states | Co-primitive with 3FLL |
| CBP | Constrains admissible transformations on IIS | Architectural consequence |
| Resolution | Maps IIS to Boolean actuality | Interface (Part II) |

The framework is now complete enough to address foundational objections.
