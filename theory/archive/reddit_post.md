**Title:** Logic Realism Theory: Deriving Quantum Mechanics from the Laws of Logic (pre-print series now on Zenodo)

---

**Post:**

I've been developing a framework called Logic Realism Theory (LRT) that takes a different approach to quantum foundations. The core claim: the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) aren't just rules of reasoning—they're ontological constraints that physical distinguishability must satisfy.

From this single thesis, quantum mechanics emerges as the unique stable structure at the interface between non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality.

**What LRT derives (not postulates):**
- Complex Hilbert space structure (via Masanes-Müller reconstruction)
- The Born rule (via Gleason's theorem from the interface structure)
- Unitary dynamics (from information preservation)
- Why quantum mechanics uses complex numbers, not real (confirmed experimentally by Renou et al. 2021)

**What makes it falsifiable:**
The papers specify 12 explicit conditions that would refute the framework—including testable predictions about collapse mechanisms and the Tsirelson bound.

**TL;DR:** Every measurement yields one outcome—self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. LRT argues this isn't coincidence but necessity: the laws of logic constrain what can be physically distinguished. Quantum mechanics is what you get at the boundary.

Happy to discuss and receive critical feedback. The framework explicitly invites falsification.
