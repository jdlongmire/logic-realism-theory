## Abstract

This paper advances Logic Realism Theory (LRT), the thesis that the three classical laws of logic - identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle - are not merely cognitive conventions, linguistic rules, or useful heuristics, but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself. The argument proceeds from two observations: (1) no physical manifestation, observed or unobserved, violates these laws, and (2) human representational capacity is sufficient to detect such violations were they to occur. An inference to the best explanation establishes that the logical laws are structural features of reality rather than artifacts of cognition or language. The paper introduces the Infinite Information Space (IIS) as a co-primitive with the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL): while 3FLL constitute what it means for states to be distinguishable, IIS is the totality of distinguishable states so constituted. The paper defends this thesis against six major objections: unfalsifiability, category error, the Kantian transcendental alternative, the epistemic gap for unobserved reality, quantum mechanical challenges, and dialetheism. Each objection is shown to fail, leaving Logic Realism as a well-supported metaphysical position. A companion paper develops the implications for quantum mechanics, showing that quantum structure is the unique stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality.

## 1. Introduction

What is the status of the laws of logic? Are they descriptions of how minds must think, conventions governing language, useful fictions for reasoning, or features of reality itself? This question sits at the intersection of metaphysics, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of science, yet it rarely receives the sustained attention it deserves.

Four broad positions present themselves:

**Psychologism** holds that logical laws describe how human minds operate. They are empirical generalizations about cognition - perhaps hardwired by evolution, perhaps culturally acquired, but ultimately facts about us rather than about the world.

**Conventionalism** treats logical laws as rules we adopt for linguistic convenience. Like traffic laws, they coordinate behavior without describing anything beyond our practices. We could, in principle, adopt different conventions.

**Instrumentalism** views logical laws as useful tools that help us navigate experience. They work, but the question of their ultimate truth or correspondence to reality is either unanswerable or unimportant.

**Realism** maintains that logical laws are features of reality itself. They hold not because we think them or stipulate them, but because reality has a certain structure that our thought and language must respect if they are to track truth.

This paper defends the fourth position. Specifically, it defends **Logic Realism Theory** (LRT): the classical laws of logic are ontological constraints on physical reality. They are not imposed by minds onto an indifferent world; they are structural features that any physical state of affairs must instantiate in order to exist, persist, and enter into causal relations.

The argument is straightforward but powerful. It rests on two observations and an inference to the best explanation. The observations are empirical in character; the inference is abductive. Together they establish that logical structure is not merely "in the head" but "in the world."

A central innovation of this paper is the introduction of the **Infinite Information Space** (IIS) as a co-primitive alongside the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL). This is not a grounding relation where one explains the other. Rather, 3FLL and IIS are mutually constitutive: without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated noise; without IIS, 3FLL would have nothing to structure. Together they form the minimal ontological base from which the distinction between possibility and actuality can be articulated.

This paper establishes the philosophical foundation. A companion paper - "It from Bit, Bit from Fit: Why Quantum Mechanics Survives" - develops the implications for physics, showing that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that interfaces between IIS and Boolean actuality.

The present paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents core definitions and the thesis. Section 3 develops the central argument. Sections 4 through 9 address six major objections. Section 10 introduces IIS as co-primitive. Section 11 draws implications. Section 12 concludes.

## 2. Core Definitions and Thesis

### 2.1 The Three Fundamental Logical Laws

Logic Realism Theory concerns the three classical laws of logic as formulated in the Aristotelian tradition:

**The Law of Identity:** A = A. A thing is identical to itself.

**The Law of Non-Contradiction:** ¬(A ∧ ¬A). A proposition cannot be both true and false simultaneously; equivalently, a thing cannot both have and lack the same property in the same respect at the same time.

**The Law of Excluded Middle:** A ∨ ¬A. For any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true; there is no third option.

These laws are foundational to classical logic and underwrite the inferential practices of mathematics, science, and ordinary reasoning. Aristotle's canonical treatment of these principles, particularly the law of non-contradiction, appears in Book Gamma of the *Metaphysics*, where he declares it "the firmest of all principles."

We refer to these collectively as the **Three Fundamental Logical Laws** (3FLL).

### 2.2 Key Terms

**Physical reality** refers to any physical manifestation - any state of affairs, object, property, event, or process that exists in the physical world, whether observed or unobserved. The claim is ontological, concerning the complete physical ontology, not merely our epistemic access to it.

**Actualization** means coming into being, existing, or obtaining. When we say nothing "actualizes" in violation of the laws, we mean no physical state of affairs exists that violates them.

**Conceivability** is understood in the syntactic or representational sense: humans can form mental representations, sentences, or symbols that describe violations of logical laws. We can write "This apple is entirely green and entirely not-green at the same instant." This capacity is sufficient for detection purposes - if genuine violations occurred, they would register as anomalies in our physical descriptions.

**Distinguishability** is the capacity to differentiate one state from another. As we shall argue, 3FLL constitute what it means for states to be distinguishable at all.

### 2.3 A Note on Scope

This paper focuses on **physical reality** - physical states of affairs, objects, properties, events, and processes. One might ask whether the thesis applies more broadly: to mental states, abstract objects, or any reality whatsoever.

We believe it does. The argument, if sound, establishes that 3FLL are constitutive of any reality that exhibits structure, persistence, or causal relations. Mental states (if real) must be self-identical and non-contradictory. Abstract objects (if real) must satisfy excluded middle. The restriction to physical reality is methodological, not principled:

**Methodological clarity.** Physical reality provides the clearest test case. We have well-developed physical theories, extensive empirical data, and strong intuitions about what would count as a violation. Mental and abstract domains are more contested.

**Avoiding side debates.** Extending the thesis to mental states requires taking positions on philosophy of mind; extending to abstract objects requires taking positions on mathematical ontology. These are important debates but orthogonal to the present argument.

**Conservative presentation.** If 3FLL are constitutive even of physical reality - the domain most likely to surprise us with violations - then the case for broader scope becomes stronger.

Readers who accept the argument for physical reality may extend it as they see fit. We suspect the extension is warranted, but establishing it for physical reality is sufficient for present purposes and for the companion paper on quantum mechanics.

### 2.4 The Thesis

**Logic Realism Theory:** The three classical laws of logic are not merely rules governing thought or language, but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself. Any physical state of affairs must instantiate identity, non-contradiction, and determinacy in order to exist.

The core thesis can be expressed formally:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{I}$ represents the Infinite Information Space (the totality of logically distinguishable states)
- $\mathfrak{L}$ represents the Logical Filtering Operator (the constraints imposed by 3FLL)
- $\mathcal{A}$ represents Actuality (the realized physical world)

This equation encapsulates the framework's central claim: actuality is not primitive but emerges from logical constraints applied to possibility space. The components of this equation - particularly IIS - are developed fully in Section 10.

This thesis is ontological rather than epistemological. It asserts something about the structure of reality, not merely about what we can know or how we must think.

## 3. The Central Argument

### 3.1 The Two Observations

**Observation 1:** No physical manifestation, observed or unobserved, violates the three laws of logic.

This is not merely an empirical generalization from limited data. Every successful physical theory, every measurement, every causal interaction we have documented respects logical structure. No state of affairs has ever been recorded that instantiates a contradiction. The universality is striking.

Consider the attempts to interpret quantum mechanics as violating the law of non-contradiction. Despite the strangeness of superposition, entanglement, and the measurement problem, quantum physics has consistently resisted interpretation as genuinely contradictory. What we find instead are complementarity frameworks, contextual properties, and probabilistic descriptions - all of which preserve logical consistency. The companion paper addresses this in detail.

**Observation 2:** Human representational capacity is sufficient to detect violations of the logical laws were they to occur.

This observation is crucial for blocking a deflationary explanation. One might claim that we observe no violations simply because our cognitive apparatus is blind to them - that contradictions exist but we cannot recognize them.

Several considerations tell against this deflationary move:

*Syntactic representation.* We can form representations of contradictions. We can write sentences describing violations. We understand what it would mean for something to violate non-contradiction - "This apple is entirely green and entirely not-green at the same instant." Our representational apparatus is sensitive enough that a genuine violation would create detectable anomalies in our physical descriptions.

*Evolutionary pressure.* Contradictions are informational catastrophes. They eliminate inferential gradients. No agent could use contradictions to guide action because contradictions erase the difference between possible futures. If reality contained action-relevant contradictions, organisms that detected them would have survival advantages. Instead, evolution favored organisms that treat apparent contradictions as errors to be resolved - strong evidence that contradictions do not occur in survival-relevant reality.

*Scientific instrumentation.* Our detection capacity extends far beyond unaided cognition. We have instruments sensitive to phenomena our ancestors could not conceive - quantum states, gravitational waves, cosmic background radiation. If logical violations occurred at any scale we can probe, the systematic success of logically-structured physical theories would be inexplicable.

**An important qualification:** This observation claims sufficiency for detection, not infallibility. One might worry that if reality were genuinely contradictory, our entire descriptive apparatus - built on consistent logic - might break in ways we cannot anticipate from inside a consistent framework. This is a serious epistemological concern.

However, it proves too much. If our cognitive apparatus is so radically limited that we cannot even detect that it is failing, then no metaphysical claim whatsoever is secure - including the claim that reality might be contradictory. The skeptical hypothesis undermines itself. More constructively: the systematic, cross-domain, instrument-extended success of logically-structured science gives us strong (though not infallible) evidence that our apparatus is tracking something real. We cannot achieve certainty here, but we can achieve reasonable confidence.

These observations are independent and play orthogonal roles: Observation 1 concerns the world; Observation 2 concerns our capacity to detect. Together they establish that the absence of observed violations is evidentially significant - not certain, but strongly supported.

### 3.2 Candidate Explanations

Why do we observe no violations of logical laws in physical reality? Six candidate explanations present themselves:

**Candidate 1: Coincidence.** Perhaps it is mere happenstance that no violations have occurred in the portion of reality we have accessed. This explanation is implausible given the universality of the observation across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry. Coincidence becomes untenable as an explanation for exceptionless regularity.

**Candidate 2: Cognitive limitation.** Perhaps violations exist but our minds cannot detect them. This is ruled out by Observation 2. Our representational capacity is sufficient to form descriptions of violations. If they occurred, we would notice.

**Candidate 3: Constitutive constraint.** The laws of logic are structural features of reality itself. Nothing actualizes in violation of them because nothing can - logical structure is a precondition for any state of affairs to exist.

**Candidate 4: Logical structure is analytic.** Perhaps "violations of logic" are not impossible states but pseudo-propositions with no sense. Logic is not about reality's structure but about what counts as coherent description.

However, this explanation cannot account for the predictive success of mathematical physics. Our mathematical models succeed even when their assumptions are physically impossible: imaginary-mass solutions predict correct scattering behavior, continuum assumptions yield correct predictions in discrete systems, idealizations like zero friction still predict accurately. If mathematical success depended on linguistic grammar, then changing false assumptions should break predictions. But predictions are robust: the structure works despite idealized ontology.

**Candidate 5: Observer selection effect.** If observation requires logical structure, we would necessarily find ourselves in logically structured regions even if violations exist elsewhere.

This explanation is insufficient. It requires that structured regions instantiate logical laws anyway - relocating rather than eliminating the question. And it does not explain the fine-grained logical alignment we observe across all domains, including those causally disconnected from us.

**Candidate 6: Logic applies to descriptions, not described.** Perhaps all descriptions must be logically structured while what is described need not be.

This position is coherent but explanatorily inadequate. It cannot explain why descriptions continue to work across radically new physical domains, why mathematics predicts phenomena no one designed the mathematics for, or why the world is so comprehensively modelable. Moreover, even the distinction between description and described presupposes identity and non-contradiction.

### 3.3 Inference to the Best Explanation

Candidates 1 and 2 fail immediately. Candidates 4, 5, and 6 fail to explain the predictive success of mathematics, the uniformity of logical structure across disconnected regions, and the asymmetry between description and reality. Only Candidate 3 remains.

By inference to the best explanation:

**The laws of logic are constitutive constraints on physical reality.**

This is not to say that reality "obeys" logic as a student obeys a teacher. It is to say that reality instantiates logical structure - that determinate, non-contradictory, self-identical existence is what it means to be a physical state of affairs.

## 4. Objection 1: Unfalsifiability

### 4.1 The Objection

The first objection charges Logic Realism with unfalsifiability. When confronted with an apparent logical violation, the defender of LRT has several moves available:

1. "You misdescribed the state of affairs."
2. "The predicates are not genuinely contradictory."
3. "Equivocation - the terms shifted meaning."
4. "That is not one thing, but two things."
5. "That is not one time, but two times."

If any purported counterexample can be deflected, Logic Realism is unfalsifiable, and unfalsifiable claims are not meaningful empirical assertions.

### 4.2 Response

The objection correctly identifies something important: Logic Realism is not an empirical hypothesis subject to Popperian falsification in the standard sense. It is a **framework claim** - a transcendental thesis about the conditions of possibility for any empirical investigation whatsoever.

This must be acknowledged honestly. LRT is more like "there is an external world" or "the future will resemble the past" than like "there are black holes at the center of galaxies." Framework claims are not tested by individual observations but by the overall coherence, fruitfulness, and indispensability of the framework they constitute.

Nevertheless, Logic Realism is not immune to challenge. It faces what we might call **transcendental falsifiers** - not individual empirical counterexamples, but demonstrations that the framework is dispensable or incoherent:

**Falsifier 1:** A coherent, mathematically well-defined model of reality in which identity fails, contradictions function without systemic collapse, or excluded middle is rejected while the model remains internally complete and predictive. No such model has ever been produced. Even exotic logics embed classical consistency at the meta-level.

**Falsifier 2:** A predictive framework that operates without the law of identity, consistency, or determinate truth-values. No predictive discipline has ever functioned this way.

**Falsifier 3:** A demonstration that contradictions enhance prediction, that incoherent propositions can be reliably evaluated, or that inconsistent information yields anything other than inferential noise.

Critics will rightly note that these falsifiers set a high bar - perhaps impossibly high. Asking for a successful predictive theory that dispenses with classical meta-logic may be asking for something that cannot exist. But this is precisely the point. If logical structure cannot be dispensed with even in principle, that is evidence for its constitutive status, not evidence of ad hoc immunization.

The empirical record supports this reading: no physical theory uses paraconsistent logic. Quantum field theory, general relativity, and the Standard Model all employ classical logic at the meta-level. Paraconsistent logics are meta-mathematical tools for salvaging inconsistent formal systems - they do not describe inconsistent worlds.

The proper comparison is not to ordinary empirical hypotheses but to other framework claims. Is "there is an external world" unfalsifiable? In some sense, yes - any apparent evidence against it can be reinterpreted. But we do not conclude that external-world realism is meaningless. We conclude that some claims are framework-level, and their justification is holistic rather than piecemeal.

Logic Realism is falsified if someone can show that coherent description, prediction, or interaction with reality is possible without logical structure. No one has shown this. Until they do, the framework stands.

## 5. Objection 2: Category Error

### 5.1 The Objection

Logic governs relations between propositions - statements that bear truth values. Physical reality consists of states of affairs - objects, properties, events. The objection charges that applying logical laws to reality itself is a category mistake. Reality does not "obey" or "violate" logic any more than an apple obeys modus ponens.

### 5.2 Response

The objection treats logical laws as syntactic rules for sentences rather than structural constraints on being. This position is coherent but explanatorily inadequate.

The view cannot explain why the world is modelable, why interventions work, why mathematics maps to physical law, why all observed causal relations are logically structured, why no physical counterexamples exist, or why science works at all.

Consider discoveries of physical structures that were unknown, not conceptualized, and not part of any representation, but were forced upon us by recalcitrant data: neutrinos, antimatter, the Higgs boson, dark matter, quarks. These were not linguistic artifacts shaped by conceptual schemes; they were surprises. A conceptual scheme cannot generate constraints it does not contain.

Moreover, the law of identity does not merely say "sentences must refer to themselves consistently." It says something more basic: whatever exists is what it is, rather than something else. A particle does not "obey" identity like a student obeys a rule. It instantiates a structural feature - being itself, being determinate, being non-self-contradictory. These are properties of being, not properties of sentences.

The objector cannot coherently deny reality has determinate structure; they can only refuse to call that structure "logical." But if the structure has all the formal features of logic - identity, consistency, determinacy - refusing to call it logical is purely terminological.

---

## 6. Objection 3: The Kantian Alternative

### 6.1 The Objection

A competing explanation for Observation 1 exists. The Kantian alternative holds that logic is not a feature of reality but a precondition for any possible experience, representation, or cognition. We cannot observe violations because observation itself presupposes logical structure. The absence of violations tells us about the necessary structure of cognition, not about mind-independent reality.

This alternative accounts for the same data and might claim parsimony: Logic Realism posits logical structure in cognition and in mind-independent reality, while Kantianism posits only the former.

A sophisticated modern variant combines Kantian insights with **structural realism**: perhaps we cannot know the intrinsic nature of things-in-themselves, but we can know their structural relations - and logical structure is among what we can know. On this view, logical structure might be "in reality" in some sense, but our access to it is always mediated by cognitive preconditions.

### 6.2 Response

The Kantian position cannot explain several key features of our epistemic situation.

**The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.** If mathematics merely describes cognitive structure, not reality, then the predictive success of novel mathematical structures becomes miraculous. Einstein's field equations predicted gravitational waves decades before detection. Dirac's equation predicted antimatter before it was observed. Maxwell's equations predicted radio waves. These structures were discovered, not imposed. Logic Realism explains the fit between abstract structure and physical behavior: mathematics works because reality instantiates the same structural regularities that mathematics expresses.

The Kantian can respond that this fit is a brute fact we must live with - a remarkable coincidence between cognitive structure and phenomenal regularity. But this response has significant cost: it renders the success of mathematical physics unexplained, whereas Logic Realism explains it directly.

**The possibility of surprise and discovery.** If cognition structures experience, then reality cannot push back in ways that surprise us. But science progresses precisely because nature contradicts expectations. Quantum mechanics was shocking. Non-Euclidean geometry was counterintuitive. Dark energy blindsided cosmology. These are not the behaviors of a world shaped by cognition; they are the behaviors of cognition encountering something external.

**The success of causal intervention.** Kantian mediation covers perceiving the world. It does not straightforwardly cover changing the world. We build lasers, alter quantum states, induce chemical reactions, send spacecraft beyond the solar system. These are causal engagements, not mere perceptions. If the world were not structured according to determinate, non-contradictory relations, interventions would not yield repeatable outcomes.

The Kantian can reply that the causal powers we manipulate are still phenomenal - we intervene in the world-as-experienced, not the world-in-itself. But this reply strains credibility when the interventions have effects independent of any particular observer: a spacecraft continues its trajectory whether anyone observes it; a nuclear reaction proceeds whether anyone measures it.

**The form/content distinction.** A sophisticated Kantian might argue that surprise affects the *content* of experience but not the *form*. We can be surprised that neutrinos exist (content), but we cannot experience a neutrino that both exists and does not exist (form). The success of science in discovering surprising content does not prove that logical form is mind-independent.

This objection has force, but the intervention argument cuts deeper. Consider: when we design a microchip, we rely on the logical structure of Boolean gates. The chip works - it computes, it controls machinery, it enables communication - whether or not anyone observes it working. The *form* of logic (identity, non-contradiction) is embedded in the *causal structure* of the device, not merely in our perception of it. If logical form were only in our minds, we would expect interventions based on that form to fail when the device operates unobserved. They do not fail.

The same applies to any technology: bridges stay up, medications work, satellites orbit. These are not perceptions filtered through cognitive form - they are causal successes that require logical structure to be in the world, not merely in our representation of it. The Kantian can maintain that we cannot *prove* this with certainty, but Logic Realism provides the simpler and more unified explanation.

**Parsimony reconsidered.** Kantianism's apparent simplicity conceals substantial machinery: an unknowable thing-in-itself, a strict phenomenal-noumenal divide, a cognitive structure that happens to map perfectly onto scientific structure, an unexplained harmony between thought and nature. Logic Realism says: the world has structure, we detect that structure - that is all. This is the leaner ontology.

**Engaging structural realism.** The structural realist variant is more sophisticated and closer to Logic Realism in spirit. If structural realism says "we can know the structural features of reality, including logical structure," then it converges with LRT on the key point: logical structure is in reality, not merely in cognition. The remaining disagreement concerns whether we can know anything beyond structure - a debate orthogonal to the present thesis.

We acknowledge that the Kantian position is not refuted - from within experience, it cannot be definitively ruled out. But Logic Realism is the better explanation: simpler, more unified, and able to account for mathematical effectiveness, surprise, and intervention success without unexplained coincidences.

## 7. Objection 4: The Epistemic Gap for Unobserved Reality

### 7.1 The Objection

Logic Realism claims that no physical manifestation - observed or unobserved - violates the logical laws. But our evidence base consists entirely of observed phenomena. The inference from "no observed violations" to "no violations anywhere" is inductive and therefore fallible.

Specific pressure points arise: we have no access to what lies beyond the cosmological horizon, the first Planck moments after the Big Bang, phenomena below the Planck length, or inside black hole singularities.

### 7.2 Response

Logic Realism is not an inductive generalization from observed samples. It is a transcendental-ontological claim about what anything must be in order to qualify as a physical state of affairs.

Consider the spatial gap. Could logic fail beyond the cosmological horizon? The question is malformed. For a region of spacetime to exist, it must have determinate identity, non-contradictory metric structure, and persistent causal relations. If those fail, "region of spacetime" is no longer meaningful.

The same applies to the temporal and scale gaps. If the early universe lacked logical structure, it would not have been a universe. It would not have had states, transitions, or causal continuity capable of producing anything later.

Logic Realism does not claim all possible universes must obey classical physics. It claims any universe must instantiate identity, non-contradiction, and determinacy in order to count as a universe. Without these, there are no states, no laws, no events, no persistence, no causal relations.

---

## 8. Objection 5: Quantum Mechanics

### 8.1 The Objection

Quantum mechanics is often presented as challenging classical logic:

- Superposition: "The particle is here AND there"
- Wave-particle duality: "It is a wave AND a particle"
- Quantum logic: The lattice of quantum propositions is non-distributive
- Measurement: Definite outcomes from indefinite states

If quantum mechanics violates classical logic, Logic Realism fails at the most fundamental level of physics.

### 8.2 Response

Quantum mechanics does not violate 3FLL. This point is so important that the companion paper treats it in detail. Here we offer the essential response.

**Superposition is not contradiction.** A superposition α|A⟩ + β|B⟩ is ONE state, not two contradictory states. The state vector is a perfectly definite mathematical object. It represents indeterminacy with respect to measurement outcomes, not the instantiation of contradictory properties.

**The crucial distinction: indeterminacy is not contradiction.** A system in superposition lacks a definite value for certain observables. This is *indeterminacy* - the absence of a determinate value. It is not *contradiction* - the presence of two conflicting values. The difference is fundamental:

- Contradiction: The electron is at position x AND the electron is not at position x (simultaneously, in the same respect)
- Indeterminacy: The electron does not have a definite position (prior to measurement)

The first violates non-contradiction. The second does not. Quantum mechanics involves pervasive indeterminacy but zero contradiction.

**Contextuality and Kochen-Specker.** The Kochen-Specker theorem shows that quantum properties cannot all have definite values independent of measurement context. This is sometimes presented as a challenge to classical logic. It is not.

Contextuality means: "The value obtained for observable A may depend on which other observables are measured alongside A." This violates **classical value definiteness** - the assumption that all properties have pre-existing definite values. But classical value definiteness is a physical assumption, not a logical law. One can reject it while fully preserving identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle.

Logic Realism is not Classical Physics Realism. We do not claim that all physical properties must behave classically. We claim that whatever properties exist must satisfy 3FLL. Quantum contextuality is perfectly compatible with this: contextual properties are still self-identical, non-contradictory, and (relative to their context) determinate.

**Measurement yields definite outcomes.** Every quantum measurement produces exactly one result. The Born rule gives probabilities, but probabilities attach to exclusive outcomes. No measurement ever produces a contradictory result.

**Quantum logic is contextual, not contradictory.** The non-distributive structure of quantum propositions reflects the contextuality of measurement - not all properties are simultaneously well-defined. But this is not contradiction. It is incompleteness relative to a classical expectation of simultaneous definite values.

**QM meticulously preserves 3FLL.** The formalism - Hilbert spaces, unitary evolution, projection operators - is built on classical mathematics. The theory makes no sense without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle at the meta-level.

The companion paper shows that quantum mechanics is best understood as the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (where indeterminate states live) and Boolean actuality (where 3FLL are fully enforced). QM does not violate logic; it is what physics looks like when logical structure meets physical actualization.

## 9. Objection 6: Dialetheism

### 9.1 The Objection

Dialetheism holds that some contradictions are true - that there exist propositions P such that both P and ¬P obtain. This directly challenges the law of non-contradiction.

The position has sophisticated formal machinery. Paraconsistent logics like LP (Logic of Paradox) are well-defined systems where contradictions can be true without explosion. The Liar Paradox is offered as a case where accepting true contradiction is simpler than alternatives. Modern dialetheists - notably Graham Priest, JC Beall, and Zach Weber - have developed increasingly sophisticated frameworks, including non-contractive consequence relations that block the spread of contradiction without eliminating it entirely.

### 9.2 Response

We take dialetheism seriously as the most developed challenge to the law of non-contradiction. The response proceeds on several fronts.

**The Liar Paradox does not demonstrate true contradictions.** The Liar sentence generates paradox by applying "truth" self-referentially within a single semantic level. Tarski showed that truth for a language cannot be defined within that language without generating paradoxes. The Liar is a linguistic illusion created by collapsing meta-levels, not a revelation of metaphysical facts. Dialetheists find the Tarskian hierarchy inelegant; we find it explanatory.

**Mathematical coherence does not entail metaphysical reality.** Paraconsistent logics show that contradictions can be manipulated symbolically without trivializing inference. This demonstrates mathematical possibility, not ontological possibility. We also have non-well-founded set theories, inconsistent arithmetics, and hyperintensional logics; none entail that their exotic features are instantiated in reality. The question is not whether we can build formal systems with true contradictions, but whether reality contains them.

**Non-contractive systems relocate the problem.** Modern dialetheism employs non-contractive consequence relations to block the spread of contradiction: from A and A → B, you cannot always derive B if A is contradictory. This is ingenious, but it amounts to quarantining contradictions rather than showing they are metaphysically benign. If contradictions must be carefully walled off to prevent systemic collapse, this suggests they are pathological rather than revelatory. Moreover, the non-contractive framework itself is specified using classical meta-logic.

**Vagueness does not imply contradiction.** Boundary cases involve vague concepts, not contradictory reality. A heap is not a natural kind; it is a loose human category. Boundary fuzziness is in our concepts, not in the sand. Supervaluationism and other classical treatments handle vagueness without contradiction.

**The self-defeat concern.** To state "P ∧ ¬P is true," one must treat P and ¬P as distinguishable. If both are true in the same respect, what distinguishes asserting P from asserting ¬P? Dialetheists have responses here - they maintain that contradiction does not collapse all distinctions. But this requires increasingly fine-grained machinery that itself presupposes non-contradictory meta-theoretic distinctions.

**The decisive consideration: no dialetheic physics.** Whatever the merits of dialetheism in philosophical logic, it has zero purchase in natural science. There is no paraconsistent physics, chemistry, cosmology, biology, or engineering. No scientific theory has ever employed dialetheist logic even in principle. Every successful physical theory - classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, the Standard Model - presupposes classical logic at the meta-level.

This is not because scientists are unaware of paraconsistent logic. It is because contradictions are inferentially catastrophic in empirical contexts. From a contradiction, classical logic allows deriving anything (explosion). Paraconsistent logics block explosion, but they do so by restricting inference - making the logic weaker, not by making contradictions informative. A physics built on true contradictions would have no predictive power: if the electron is here AND not here, what do we expect to measure?

The absence of any dialetheic science is strong evidence that whatever role contradictions play in pure logic, they play no role in the structure of physical reality. Logic Realism stands.

## 10. The Infinite Information Space

### 10.1 Introduction of IIS

Having established that 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, we now introduce a crucial structural element: the **Infinite Information Space** (IIS).

IIS is not derived from 3FLL, nor are 3FLL derived from IIS. They are **co-primitive** - mutually constitutive elements that together form the minimal ontological base. This section develops the concept, addresses questions about its modal status, and defends the co-primitiveness claim.

### 10.2 The Relationship

The relationship can be precisely characterized:

**3FLL constitute distinguishability.** Without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle, there is no basis for one state to be different from another. Distinguishability is not a primitive fact; it is what 3FLL establish.

**IIS is the totality of distinguishable states.** Given that distinguishability is constituted, IIS is the space of everything so distinguished - every possible informational configuration.

The dependency is mutual:
- Without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated - no state distinct from any other
- Without IIS, 3FLL would have nothing to structure - no domain of application

We can now expand the thesis equation introduced in Section 2.3. The operator $\mathfrak{L}$ actually encompasses two distinct operations:

$$\mathfrak{L} = \mathfrak{P} \circ \mathfrak{C}$$

Where:
- $\mathfrak{C}$ represents the constitutive constraints (3FLL establishing distinguishability)
- $\mathfrak{P}$ represents the parsimony principle (selecting among paths in the constituted space)
- $\circ$ represents functional composition

Thus the full formulation becomes:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{P}(\mathfrak{C}(\mathcal{I}))$$

This makes explicit that logical structure first constitutes the space of possibilities, then parsimony selects within it. The constitutive operation ($\mathfrak{C}$) is what this paper has established. The selection operation ($\mathfrak{P}$) is derived from constitution and grounding in the companion papers (see Section 10.5).

### 10.3 The Modal Status of IIS

What kind of thing is IIS? This question deserves careful treatment.

**IIS is not a Platonic realm.** We do not posit abstract objects floating in a separate domain. IIS is not "somewhere else" - it is the structural space of what can be distinguished.

**IIS is not a set-theoretic construction.** We do not define IIS as a set of possible worlds or a collection of maximal consistent state-descriptions. Such constructions face well-known cardinality paradoxes (how big is the set of all possible states?). IIS is better understood as a structural concept - what 3FLL make possible - than as a completed totality.

**IIS is not merely epistemic.** It does not represent what we do not know about an otherwise determinate reality. IIS contains genuinely indeterminate states - configurations that are distinguishable but not yet resolved into definite actuality.

**The positive characterization:** IIS is the **space of possibility** constituted by logical distinguishability. It is what can be, given that distinction is possible at all. Its "existence" is not the existence of a thing among things, but the existence of a structural condition - the condition under which there can be distinct states at all.

This may seem abstract, but it parallels standard moves in philosophy of modality. Just as possible worlds semantics does not require believing in concrete parallel universes, IIS does not require believing in a separate realm of informational states. It is a framework for articulating what follows from the constitutive role of 3FLL.

### 10.4 What "Information" Means in IIS

The term "information" invites misunderstanding. We must specify what we mean.

**Not Shannon information.** Shannon information is a statistical measure of surprise or entropy, defined relative to a probability distribution over messages. IIS is not a communication channel and does not presuppose senders, receivers, or probability distributions.

**Not semantic information.** Semantic information concerns meaning - what propositions are about. IIS is more primitive than meaning; it concerns what can be distinguished, not what distinctions mean.

**Not physical information (in the usual sense).** Physical information typically refers to degrees of freedom in a physical system - bits stored in memory, quantum states of particles. But IIS is not itself a physical system; it is the space from which physical systems are actualized.

**What we do mean: distinguishability structure.** "Information" in IIS refers to the structure of possible distinctions. A "state" in IIS is whatever can be distinguished from other states. The "information content" of a region of IIS is the complexity of distinctions it contains.

This usage aligns with a tradition running from Bateson ("information is a difference that makes a difference") through Wheeler ("it from bit"). Information, in this sense, is more fundamental than matter or energy - it is the structure of distinction itself.

**Avoiding Platonism.** Does this make IIS a Platonic realm of abstract objects? No, for several reasons:

1. IIS is not populated by eternal, unchanging Forms. Its "contents" are structural possibilities, not ideal archetypes.
2. IIS does not exist independently of 3FLL; they are co-constitutive.
3. The question "where is IIS?" is malformed. IIS is not located anywhere because location is a feature of actualized spacetime, and IIS is the condition for any such actualization.

The risk of Pythagoreanism - the view that "structure is substance" or "mathematics is reality" - is real but navigable. We do not claim that IIS is made of mathematics. We claim that IIS is the structural space that 3FLL constitute, and that physical reality is what actualizes within it. The relationship is constitutive, not compositional.

### 10.5 Why Parsimony?

The thesis equation includes a parsimony operator ($\mathfrak{P}$) that selects among possibilities. Why parsimony rather than some other principle?

This question receives full treatment in the companion papers, where parsimony is derived from more fundamental commitments. The key insight is that parsimony follows from the constitutive nature of 3FLL combined with grounding requirements for Boolean assignment. We summarize the reasoning here:

**Constitution generates exactly its content.** If 3FLL constitute actuality, then actuality contains exactly what 3FLL (plus contingent initial conditions) generate - no more, no less. This is the Constitutive Closure Principle.

**Boolean assignment requires grounds.** For a proposition to have a genuine Boolean value in actuality, something must determine that value. Propositions without grounds cannot be genuinely true or false - only stipulated.

**Surplus structure has no grounds.** Any structure beyond what the constitutive package generates would lack grounding. Ungrounded propositions cannot be actual.

**Therefore actuality is minimal.** Actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions. This is parsimony - not as a methodological preference but as a structural consequence of constitution and grounding.

The companion papers (Paper 2, Section 4.3; Paper 3, Section 3.6) develop this derivation formally. The result: parsimony is a theorem of LRT, not an independent assumption.

### 10.6 Defending Co-Primitiveness

The claim that 3FLL and IIS are co-primitive may seem stipulative - a way of avoiding the hard question of which is more fundamental. We defend it as follows:

**The grounding regress.** If 3FLL ground IIS, what grounds 3FLL? If IIS grounds 3FLL, what grounds IIS? Any grounding chain must terminate somewhere. We propose that 3FLL and IIS terminate together - neither grounds the other because each requires the other to be what it is.

**Mutual constitution is coherent.** Consider the relationship between a metric and a space. The metric defines distances; the space is what has distances. Neither is prior - they are co-constitutive aspects of a single structure. Similarly, 3FLL and IIS are co-constitutive aspects of the structure of distinguishability.

**The bootstrapping objection.** One might ask: if IIS is noise without 3FLL, and 3FLL is empty without IIS, how does the system "start"? This objection assumes that constitution requires temporal or causal priority. It does not.

The dependence between 3FLL and IIS is **structural**, not temporal or causal. Consider an analogy: the north and south poles of a magnet are mutually dependent - you cannot have one without the other. But neither pole causes or temporally precedes the other. They are co-present aspects of a single magnetic structure.

Similarly, 3FLL and IIS do not "start" in sequence. They are co-present aspects of the structure of distinguishability itself. The question "which came first?" is malformed, just as "which came first, the north pole or the south pole?" is malformed.

**The alternative is worse.** If we take 3FLL alone as primitive, we face the question: 3FLL over what domain? If we take IIS alone as primitive, we face the question: what makes its states distinguishable? The co-primitiveness thesis answers both at once.

This does not eliminate all mystery. We have not explained why there is logical structure at all. But we have pushed the primitive to the minimal point: the structure of distinguishability itself. Everything else - including physical reality - emerges from this.

### 10.7 IIS Is Not Boolean

A crucial point: while 3FLL constitute distinguishability, they do not constrain IIS to be Boolean in structure.

**Boolean** refers to a system where every element has a definite binary value - true/false, 0/1, actual/not-actual.

**IIS contains more than Boolean structure.** It contains indeterminate states - states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet resolved into definite Boolean values.

This distinction is essential:
- **IIS:** Contains all distinguishable states, including indeterminate ones
- **Actuality:** The domain where 3FLL are fully enforced - Boolean, determinate, non-contradictory

The relationship between IIS and actuality is the subject of the companion paper, where we show that quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between them.

### 10.8 The Library Analogy

Borges' Library of Babel contains every possible book - every true statement, every false statement, every string of gibberish. Most of it is noise. The meaningful books exist but are buried in infinity.

IIS is analogous. It contains every possible informational configuration. Most are not physical. Most do not correspond to anything stable. But everything distinguishable is there.

3FLL is what makes the library navigable. Without it, there are no distinct books - just undifferentiated text. 3FLL constitutes the possibility of one book being different from another.

Actuality is the book we are reading. Why this book? That question points beyond what this paper establishes. But we can say what the book is: it is one path through IIS, the one that actualizes under the constraints of 3FLL and the selection of parsimony.

## 11. Implications

### 11.1 For Philosophy of Logic

Logic Realism reframes debates about the nature of logic. Logic is neither a mere convention nor a psychological necessity; it is a structural feature of reality that thought must respect if it is to track truth. This provides a foundation for the normativity of logic: we ought to reason consistently because reality is consistent.

### 11.2 For Philosophy of Science

If logical structure is constitutive of physical reality, then science does not impose order on chaos but discovers order that is already there. The success of mathematics in physics is explained: mathematics works because it describes the same structural features that reality instantiates.

### 11.3 For Metaphysics

Logic Realism provides a minimal ontology of structure. Before asking what particular things exist, we can say something about what any existing thing must be like: determinate, self-identical, non-contradictory. This is not a complete metaphysics, but it is a constraint that any complete metaphysics must satisfy.

### 11.4 For Epistemology

The intervention argument developed against the Kantian alternative suggests a criterion for distinguishing features of cognition from features of reality: if a structure is required not only for thought but also for successful causal manipulation, the best explanation is that the structure is in the world, not merely in the mind.

---

## 12. Conclusion

Logic Realism Theory holds that the three classical laws of logic - identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle - are not cognitive conventions or linguistic rules but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality.

The argument rests on two observations: no physical manifestation violates these laws, and our representational capacity is sufficient to detect such violations. An inference to the best explanation establishes that logical structure is a feature of reality itself.

Six major objections have been addressed:

1. **Unfalsifiability:** Logic Realism faces transcendental falsifiers - demonstrations that coherent description or prediction is possible without logical structure. No such demonstration exists.

2. **Category error:** Logical laws are structural features instantiated by reality, not merely rules for sentences.

3. **Kantian alternative:** Logic Realism better explains mathematical effectiveness, surprise, and intervention success.

4. **Epistemic gap:** Logic Realism is a transcendental claim about what any physical state must be, not an inductive generalization.

5. **Quantum mechanics:** QM never violates 3FLL. Superposition is one state, not contradiction. The companion paper develops this fully.

6. **Dialetheism:** Paraconsistent logics demonstrate symbolic possibility, not ontological reality. Dialetheism is self-defeating.

We have introduced the Infinite Information Space (IIS) as co-primitive with 3FLL. They are mutually constitutive: 3FLL constitute distinguishability; IIS is the totality of distinguishable states. Together they provide the minimal base for articulating the distinction between possibility and actuality.

The companion paper - "It from Bit, Bit from Fit: Why Quantum Mechanics Survives" - develops the implications for physics. There we show that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that interfaces between IIS and Boolean actuality, and that this insight grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" in logical foundations.

The laws of logic are not merely how we think. They are how anything can be.
