Abstract

This paper defends a classical realist thesis concerning the relationship between logic and physical reality. It argues that there is a discrete distinction between being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), and that physical reality is prescriptively bound by the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle. These laws do not merely describe how we think about reality but determine what can actualize within it insofar as reality is intelligible to empirical investigation. Appeals to indeterminacy, superposition, or inconsistency are shown to concern epistemic limitation or formal representation rather than ontic contradiction. The burden of proof is placed on those who claim that reality violates classical logical constraints, requiring a demonstration of physically realized contradiction.

1. Being and Knowing

There is a discrete difference between being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology). What exists is not determined by what is known, measured, or represented, but by what is actualized. Epistemic states concern access, description, and prediction; ontic states concern what is the case independently of such access.

Failing to distinguish these domains leads to a category error in which limits of knowledge, formalism, or representation are mistaken for limits in being itself. This distinction is foundational for the argument that follows.

The thesis defended here is that the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle do not merely describe how we think about reality but prescriptively determine what can actualize within it. Physical reality is bound by these logical constraints.

2. Logic as a Condition of Empirical Intelligibility

Unless one can produce a demonstration of physical reality actualizing in violation of the classical laws of logic (identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle), those laws are prescriptive constraints on reality, not merely descriptive conventions of human thought, since denying them renders empirical investigation and explanation unintelligible.¹

Every empirical observation, measurement, and physical interaction presupposes that something is what it is, that it is not simultaneously its negation in the same respect, and that once a state is actualized it is determinate rather than indeterminate. These principles are not auxiliary assumptions appended to physics after the fact; they are the conditions under which physics, measurement, and explanation are possible at all.¹ ²

The claim here is not that logic can be proven from nothing or derived from some more fundamental principle. Rather, it is a transcendental argument: if empirical investigation is to be possible, then reality must satisfy these constraints as conditions of that possibility. One could deny the antecedent (that empirical investigation is possible), but doing so would undermine the entire scientific enterprise. The argument proceeds conditionally: given that we do investigate reality empirically, and given that such investigation has been successful, reality must satisfy the logical constraints that make investigation intelligible.

This form of argument parallels Aristotle's treatment of non-contradiction in Metaphysics Γ, where the principle is defended not by derivation from deeper axioms but as a condition for the very possibility of discourse and inquiry.¹ ² The laws of logic are not theorems to be proven but the firmest principles that make proof itself possible.

This claim does not deny the formal legitimacy of non-classical logics. Rather, it distinguishes between the permissibility of alternative logical systems as conceptual tools and the constraints required for actualized physical states to be identifiable, distinguishable, and investigable.

3. Indeterminacy, Superposition, and Ontological Overreach

Appeals to indeterminacy, superposition, or inconsistency do not constitute violations of classical logical constraints unless they can be shown to result in an actualized physical state that both is and is not, or that fails to resolve upon interaction. To date, no such demonstration exists.

Purported counterexamples consistently reduce to one of three categories: epistemic limitation, model-dependent abstraction, or conceptual representation. None of these amount to an instance of realized contradiction in physical reality itself.³ ⁴

This point is especially salient in quantum foundations. While quantum systems are represented by superposed states in the formalism, no interpretation has demonstrated a physically actualized outcome that both obtains and fails to obtain in the same respect. Measurement yields determinate results, and interaction resolves superposed descriptions into recorded outcomes, in line with standard accounts of decoherence and definite measurement records.⁵ Claims of ontic contradiction therefore exceed what the theory itself entails.

The term "actualization" here refers to what registers in causal and observational chains, what leaves determinate records, and what enters into further physical interactions. This is not a stipulative definition designed to guarantee determinacy by fiat, but rather an empirical observation: everything that has been observed to actualize in this sense has been determinate.* The question at issue is whether any counterexample to this pattern can be produced.

4. Burden of Proof and Metaphysical Commitment

Accordingly, the burden of proof rests entirely on those who claim that reality violates the laws of logic. It is not incumbent upon the defender of classical logical constraints to prove their universal validity; rather, it is incumbent upon the challenger to exhibit an instance of physically realized contradiction.

Until such an instance is produced, the rational conclusion is that the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle prescriptively bind what can exist and occur in the physical world.¹ ³ ⁶

5. Theory Structure: Predictions and Falsification Criteria

The thesis defended here is not merely a philosophical position but a falsifiable theory about physical reality. It makes specific predictions and provides clear criteria by which it could be refuted.

**Core Prediction:**
All physically actualized states will be determinate, non-contradictory, and identifiable. Every measurement outcome, every physical interaction, and every causal process will yield results that satisfy the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle.

**Falsification Criteria:**
The theory would be falsified by any of the following:

1. **Realized contradiction:** A physically actualized state that both obtains and fails to obtain in the same respect at the same time. Not a superposed representation prior to measurement, but an actual recorded outcome that is simultaneously A and not-A.

2. **Genuine indeterminacy:** A measurement outcome that is actually indeterminate upon actualization (neither one result nor another, not merely unpredictable). The criterion is not whether we can predict the outcome beforehand, but whether the outcome itself is determinate once it occurs.

3. **Identity violation:** A physical entity or state that is not itself, that fails to maintain self-identity through time or interaction, or that cannot be distinguished from its negation in principle.

4. **Contradictory causal chains:** A sequence of physical interactions in which contradictory states serve as causal links. For instance, a particle that both passes through and does not pass through a barrier, with both states causally contributing to subsequent events.

**What Does Not Constitute Falsification:**

The following do not count as counterexamples, as they concern epistemic or representational features rather than ontic actualization:

1. **Epistemic indeterminacy:** Our inability to know or predict which outcome will occur does not entail that the outcome itself is indeterminate once it actualizes.

2. **Formal superposition:** Mathematical representations that assign non-zero amplitudes to multiple outcomes do not demonstrate that reality actualizes in superposed form. The question is what registers in physical records, not what appears in the formalism.

3. **Probabilistic unpredictability:** That we can only assign probabilities to outcomes prior to measurement does not mean the outcomes themselves violate classical logical constraints when they occur.

4. **Semantic or abstract paradoxes:** Contradictions in language, self-referential statements, or set-theoretic constructions do not constitute physical actualization and therefore fall outside the scope of this theory.

**Observational Consequences:**

If the theory is correct, the following will hold across all empirical domains:

1. Every quantum measurement will yield a definite outcome (spin up or spin down, detected or not detected, etc.).
2. All physical records (detector states, measurement apparatus configurations, environmental interactions) will be determinate.
3. No detector or measurement device will register both yes and no for the same measurement event.
4. All particle interactions will preserve identity through transformations (conservation laws will hold, particle tracks will be traceable, etc.).
5. Every causal chain will consist of determinate states causally linked to other determinate states.

These consequences are not trivial. They could, in principle, be violated. The theory stakes its validity on the claim that they will not be.

**Burden of Proof:**

By specifying clear falsification criteria and observational consequences, the theory places a concrete burden on those who deny that physical reality is prescriptively bound by classical logical constraints. The challenge is not to produce a philosophical argument or a formal model, but to exhibit an actual physical instance that meets the falsification criteria above.

To date, no such instance has been produced. Until one is, the theory stands as the best account of the logical structure of physical reality.

6. Conclusion

On this view, logic is not merely a descriptive framework for organizing thought or language. It functions as a boundary condition for intelligibility itself. If reality is to be something that can be known, measured, and explained, then it must satisfy the conditions under which knowing, measuring, and explaining are possible.

Logic is therefore not imposed on reality from without; it is the minimum structure reality must exhibit in order to be intelligible at all.¹ Physical reality is prescriptively bound by the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle. These laws determine what can actualize, not merely how we describe what actualizes.

It should be noted that the scope of this thesis is limited to physical actualization in causal-temporal reality. The question of whether dialetheism, paraconsistency, or other non-classical frameworks might apply to abstract objects, semantic domains, or other areas of metaphysics is orthogonal to the present claim. The argument here concerns what can obtain in the physical world as investigated by empirical science, and Section 5 specifies the exact empirical criteria by which the theory could be falsified.

Objections and Replies

Objection 1: Dialetheism Shows That Some Contradictions Are True

Dialetheists argue that certain contradictions, particularly in semantic or set-theoretic contexts, are genuinely true, and that classical prohibitions against contradiction are therefore too strong.³

Reply:
The present thesis does not deny that contradictions can be formulated, modeled, or tolerated within formal systems. Paraconsistent and dialetheic logics are coherent as conceptual frameworks designed to manage inconsistency without triviality. The claim at issue is ontological and specifically concerns physical actualization: that no actualized physical state both is and is not in the same respect at the same time.

Dialetheist examples overwhelmingly concern linguistic, semantic, or abstract domains whose truth conditions are defined within representational systems. No case has been produced in which a physically instantiated state exhibits contradictory being. Until such a case is demonstrated, dialetheism remains a thesis about representation (or about non-physical domains of truth) rather than physical reality.³ ⁶

The scope of the present argument is deliberately limited to what can actualize in causal-temporal reality. Whether dialetheism succeeds as an account of truth in semantic or abstract domains does not affect the claim that physical reality exhibits determinate, non-contradictory states upon actualization.

Objection 2: Quantum Superposition Undermines Classical Bivalence

It is often argued that quantum superposition undermines classical bivalence or excluded middle, since systems prior to measurement are described as neither definitively one outcome nor another.⁵

Reply:
This objection conflates formal description with ontological commitment. Superposition encodes probabilistic structure and predictive limitation, not actualized contradiction. While pre-measurement states may not license definite predictions, no interpretation of quantum mechanics has shown an instance in which an actualized physical outcome both obtains and fails to obtain in the same respect.

The empirical fact is this: every measurement yields a determinate result. Every interaction that registers in an observational record produces a definite outcome. What the formalism represents as superposed, observation records as resolved. This is not a claim about what "must" be true a priori, but what has been observed a posteriori across the entire history of quantum mechanics.

Absent such a demonstration, quantum theory highlights limits of prediction rather than failures of being.⁵

Objection 3: Non-Classical Logics Undermine the Privilege of Classical Logic

Some argue that the existence and utility of non-classical logics show that classical logic has no special claim to fundamentality.⁴

Reply:
Logical pluralism at the level of formal systems is compatible with metaphysical realism about determination. The claim defended here is not that classical logic is the only useful logic, but that actualized physical reality must be determinate enough to support identity, distinction, and resolution.

Non-classical logics manage incomplete or inconsistent descriptions. They do not license the inference that reality itself lacks identity, violates non-contradiction, or fails to resolve upon interaction. The utility of a formal system for modeling, representing, or reasoning about incomplete information does not entail that the reality being modeled is itself indeterminate or contradictory.

*Footnote: This understanding of actualization is not stipulative but empirical. We identify something as actualized when it enters causal chains, produces observable effects, and leaves determinate records. The claim is that everything satisfying these criteria has been determinate. If a counterexample exists (something that actualizes in this sense but is contradictory or indeterminate), it would refute the thesis. The burden of proof is to produce such a case.
