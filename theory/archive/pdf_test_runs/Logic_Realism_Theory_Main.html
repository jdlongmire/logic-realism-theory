<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Every physical measurement ever conducted has yielded exactly one
outcome: self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. This holds
across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry, including a
century of quantum mechanics where violations were actively sought.</p>
<p>This paper argues that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity,
Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle) are not cognitive conventions
but ontological constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability.
From this thesis, quantum mechanics emerges as the unique stable
structure at the interface between non-Boolean possibility and Boolean
actuality.</p>
<p>The framework derives rather than postulates: complex Hilbert space
structure follows from interface constraints combined with the physical
requirement of compositional consistency (local tomography); the Born
rule follows from Gleason’s theorem; unitary dynamics follows from
information preservation requirements. These derivations are conditional
on both logical (3FLL) and physical (continuity, local tomography)
inputs, but this specific combination suffices to reconstruct the theory
without independent postulation.</p>
<p>One structural prediction, that quantum mechanics requires complex
amplitudes, has been experimentally confirmed (Renou et al., 2021). The
framework specifies twelve explicit conditions that would falsify it,
including fundamental information loss or underivable collapse
parameters, and makes testable predictions about collapse mechanisms
currently under experimental investigation.</p>
<p>Logic Realism Theory provides unified explanation for seventeen
quantum phenomena that other interpretations treat as independent
postulates, while maintaining realism, locality, and parsimony. The
competing interpretations either refuse ontological commitment
(Copenhagen, QBism), require massive ontological excess (Many-Worlds),
or introduce unexplained nonlocal mechanisms (Bohmian, GRW).</p>
<p>The “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics” in physics is
revealed as an illusion caused by viewing physical laws as contingent.
By strictly enforcing Global Parsimony, LRT shows that fundamental
physical constraints—from the Born Rule to Special Relativity—are the
unique mathematical solutions necessary to maintain the Three
Fundamental Laws of Logic at the interface of possibility and actuality.
There is no “Bit” without the “Fit” of logical consistency.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="the-empirical-puzzle">1.1 The Empirical Puzzle</h3>
<p>Every physical measurement ever conducted has yielded exactly one
outcome: self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. No detector has
simultaneously fired and not-fired. No particle has been measured in
contradictory states. No experimental record has ever displayed P and
¬P.</p>
<p>This pattern holds universally. Across all of physics, chemistry,
biology, and engineering, across all scales from Planck length to
cosmological horizon, across all epochs from the early universe to the
present, the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) have never been
violated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> Everything is what it is (∀x: x = x)</li>
<li><strong>Non-Contradiction:</strong> Nothing both is and is not in
the same respect (∀x,P: ¬(P(x) ∧ ¬P(x)))</li>
<li><strong>Excluded Middle:</strong> Everything either is or is not
(∀x,P: P(x) ∨ ¬P(x))</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics appeared to offer violations. Superposition looks
like “both A and not-A.” Entanglement looks like instantaneous
contradiction-propagation. The measurement problem looks like
contradictory states persisting until observed. For nearly a century,
physicists and philosophers actively sought to interpret quantum
mechanics as requiring non-classical logic.</p>
<p>Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) proposed quantum logic with
non-distributive structure. Paraconsistent approaches attempted to
formalize quantum states as true contradictions. The measurement problem
generated interpretations explicitly designed to accommodate logical
indeterminacy. Sophisticated formal tools were developed. Professional
incentives favored finding violations; it would have been a major
result.</p>
<p>Every attempt failed.</p>
<p>The failure was not for lack of formal resources. Paraconsistent
logics, developed rigorously since the 1960s (da Costa 1963; Priest
&amp; Routley 1989), provide mathematical frameworks where
contradictions do not entail everything. Dialetheism, the view that some
contradictions are true, has been seriously defended by philosophers
including Graham Priest, who argues that semantic paradoxes, vagueness,
and even motion involve true contradictions (Priest 2006). Impossible
worlds semantics models scenarios where classical logic fails (Berto
&amp; Jago 2019). Buddhist logic explored four-valued structures
(catuṣkoṭi) for millennia before Western analytic philosophy engaged
these questions.</p>
<p>These are not idle speculations. Paraconsistent logic has an official
American Mathematical Society classification (03B53). Five World
Congresses on Paraconsistency have convened since 1997. The formal
apparatus for conceiving and reasoning about 3FLL violations is mature
and mathematically rigorous.</p>
<p>Yet no physical observation has ever instantiated what these
frameworks describe. The gap between formal conceivability and physical
actuality is the core explanandum.</p>
<p>Upon careful analysis, every apparent violation dissolved.
Superposition is indeterminacy prior to measurement, not contradiction
in actuality. Entanglement produces correlations, not signals.
Wave-particle duality reflects complementary experimental contexts, not
contradictory properties. And measurement, always, without exception,
yields one definite outcome.</p>
<p>The quantum case is decisive precisely because it represents our best
opportunity to find violations. If 3FLL were going to fail anywhere in
physics, quantum mechanics is where it would happen. The formalism
practically invites the interpretation that contradictions are real. Yet
the logical structure holds.</p>
<p>This pattern demands explanation.</p>
<p>The demand is not merely philosophical. Quantum mechanics is our most
successful physical theory, yet we cannot say why it has its specific
structure: why complex Hilbert space, why the Born rule, why unitary
dynamics. This explanatory vacuum has consequences. Without agreed-upon
criteria for what counts as explanation, quantum foundations tolerates
speculation other fields would not: infinite unobservable branches,
consciousness-caused collapse, retrocausality. “Interpretation” becomes
license for speculation unconstrained by structural requirements.
Meanwhile, practical developments (quantum computing, quantum gravity)
require foundational clarity we do not have. The pattern demands
explanation, and the explanation must be disciplined.</p>
<h3 id="the-thesis">1.2 The Thesis</h3>
<p>This paper defends a physical thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic are ontological
constraints constitutive of physical distinguishability
itself.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distinguishability, the capacity for one thing to be different from
another, is not discovered in the world. It is what 3FLL establish.
Without Identity, there is no basis for a state to be determinately
itself. Without Non-Contradiction, there is no basis for a state to
exclude alternatives. Without Excluded Middle, there is no basis for
exhaustive distinction.</p>
<p>The laws are not rules we impose on experience. They are conditions
under which experience, and physical existence, are possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-asymmetry-of-burden">1.3 The Asymmetry of Burden</h3>
<p>The claim that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic are merely formal,
cognitive, linguistic, or contingently emergent carries a precise and
unmet evidential obligation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any critic who denies their ontological and constitutive status must
produce at least one verified instance of a well-defined physical
observable actualizing a non-Boolean or contradictory outcome in the
historical record of measurement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No such instance exists.</p>
<p>Every detector click, every photographic plate spot, every CCD pixel,
every gravitational-wave strain datum, every spectroscopic line,
trillions of independent events across thirteen-plus orders of magnitude
in energy and fourteen billion years, has been strictly self-identical,
non-contradictory, and determinate. The conformity is not probabilistic;
it is absolute.</p>
<p>Until a single counterexample is exhibited, the universality of 3FLL
compliance stands as an unexplained brute fact on any view that treats
the laws as optional. Logic Realism Theory removes the brute fact by
elevating the laws from unexplained regularities to the constitutive
conditions of physical distinguishability itself.</p>
<p>The burden therefore lies entirely with the objector. LRT discharges
its burden by showing that quantum mechanics is the unique stable
structure compatible with that constitutive role.</p>
<h3 id="the-consequence">1.4 The Consequence</h3>
<p>If 3FLL are constitutive of distinguishability, a structural
consequence follows.</p>
<p>Define two domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Infinite Information Space (IIS):</strong> The totality
of distinguishable configurations, everything that can be distinguished
from everything else. This space is constituted by 3FLL and contains
both determinate and indeterminate states.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boolean Actuality:</strong> The domain where 3FLL are
fully enforced, where every proposition has exactly one truth value.
This is what we call physical reality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains superpositions,
indeterminate configurations, states not yet resolved to definite
values. Boolean actuality permits only determinate states.</p>
<p>This creates an interface problem: what structure mediates between
non-Boolean IIS and Boolean actuality?</p>
<p>The answer is quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is not one option among many. Given the constraints
that 3FLL impose on any transition from possibility to actuality,
quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface structure. Classical
probability satisfies formal interface requirements but produces no
stable atoms, no chemistry, no observers. Real and quaternionic quantum
theories fail compositional requirements. Generalized probabilistic
theories exceeding quantum correlations permit signaling. Only complex
Hilbert space quantum mechanics with the Born rule produces stable
physical existence.</p>
<p>This is the central claim: quantum mechanics has its specific
structure because that structure is uniquely selected by the
requirements of the IIS-actuality interface.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-paper-establishes">1.5 What This Paper
Establishes</h3>
<p>The argument proceeds as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Section 2</strong> develops the framework: IIS, Boolean
actuality, the interface problem, and the Consistency Bridging Principle
that constrains admissible dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3</strong> presents the derivation chain: from 3FLL,
interface constraints, and physical requirements (continuity, local
tomography) to complex Hilbert space, the Born rule, and unitary
dynamics. Key results are derived from this combined foundation, not
postulated independently.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4</strong> shows what the framework explains:
seventeen quantum phenomena receive unified explanation from common
resources.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5</strong> compares Logic Realism Theory (LRT) to
competing interpretations, evaluating each as a physical theory on
common criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6</strong> presents predictions and falsifiers: what
LRT implies, what has been confirmed, what is currently testable, and
what would refute the theory.</p>
<p><strong>Section 7</strong> addresses open questions and
concludes.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-paper-claims-and-does-not-claim">1.6 What This Paper
Claims and Does Not Claim</h3>
<p><strong>LRT claims:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3FLL are ontological, not merely cognitive or linguistic</li>
<li>Quantum mechanics is the unique stable IIS-actuality interface</li>
<li>This explains otherwise unexplained features of quantum
structure</li>
<li>The framework is empirically falsifiable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LRT does not claim:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum mechanics is logically necessary (it is structurally
selected)</li>
<li>All of physics derives from logic alone (physical constraints are
also required)</li>
<li>The measurement problem is dynamically solved (it is structurally
dissolved)</li>
<li>All open questions are answered (several are explicitly
identified)</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between derivation and selection is crucial. We do
not derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. We show that quantum
mechanics is the unique structure compatible with stable
information-bearing existence given the interface requirements. This is
a selection claim with empirical content, not a claim of logical
necessity.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-framework">2. The Framework</h2>
<h3 id="distinguishability-and-the-three-laws">2.1 Distinguishability
and the Three Laws</h3>
<p>Distinguishability is not a primitive feature of reality that we
discover. It is what the Three Fundamental Laws establish.</p>
<p>For state A to be distinguishable from state B:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity</strong> must hold: A = A and B = B. Each state
must be determinately itself.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Contradiction</strong> must hold: It cannot be that A =
B and A ≠ B simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Excluded Middle</strong> must hold: Either A = B or A ≠ B.
No indeterminate middle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without these conditions, there is no basis for one state to differ
from another. Distinguishability just <em>is</em> the application of
3FLL to a domain. The laws do not describe distinguishability; they
constitute it.</p>
<p>This claim invites a circularity objection: are we defining
distinguishability in terms of 3FLL, then claiming 3FLL are necessary
for distinguishability? No. The argument is transcendental, not
definitional. We ask: what must be the case for distinguishability to be
possible at all? For state A to be distinguished from state B, A must be
determinately A (Identity), A must not simultaneously be B and not-B
(Non-Contradiction), and A must either be B or not be B (Excluded
Middle). These are not stipulations about what “distinguishability”
means; they are conditions without which distinction cannot obtain. The
question is not “what do we mean by distinguishability?” but “what makes
distinguishability possible?” The answer is 3FLL.</p>
<p>This is the foundational claim of Logic Realism Theory. The laws are
not cognitive filters we impose, not linguistic conventions we adopt,
not useful approximations we employ. They are the conditions under which
anything can be distinguished from anything else. The Technical
companion (Theorem 7.1) proves this claim is ontic rather than
epistemic: the continuity structure of quantum mechanics excludes hidden
non-Boolean tokens even at probability zero.</p>
<h3 id="the-infinite-information-space">2.2 The Infinite Information
Space</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Infinite Information Space (IIS) is
the totality of distinguishable configurations, every state that can be
distinguished from every other state, as constituted by 3FLL. IIS is
infinite in the sense that the space of distinguishable configurations
is unbounded; there is no finite limit to the distinctions that can be
drawn.</p>
<p>IIS is not: - A Platonic realm of abstract objects - A set-theoretic
construction (which would face cardinality paradoxes) - Merely epistemic
(representing what we don’t know) - Exotic new ontology added to
physics</p>
<p><strong>IIS is what physics already uses.</strong> Consider what
physicists routinely treat as real: Hilbert space (infinite-dimensional,
not embedded in spacetime), configuration space (3N dimensions for N
particles), Fock space (variable particle number), phase space (the
arena for statistical mechanics). These mathematical structures are not
“in” physical space, yet physics operates with them as describing
something physically meaningful. IIS names what these structures
represent: the space of distinguishable possibilities. The question for
skeptics is not “how can IIS be real?” but “what do you think Hilbert
space describes?” If the wavefunction is physically meaningful, it must
represent something. IIS is explicit about what.</p>
<p>IIS is the structural space of what <em>can be distinguished</em>.
Its existence is not the existence of a thing among things, but the
existence of a structural condition, the condition under which distinct
states are possible at all.</p>
<p><strong>Co-primitive with 3FLL:</strong> IIS and 3FLL are mutually
constitutive. Without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated noise, no
state distinguishable from any other. Without IIS, 3FLL would have
nothing to structure. This parallels Borges’ Library of Babel: IIS
contains every possible informational configuration; 3FLL make the
library navigable by constituting what makes one configuration
distinguishable from another.</p>
<p><strong>Functional characterization:</strong> IIS is characterized
functionally rather than by stipulating a mathematical structure at the
outset. Its properties are <em>derived</em>, not assumed. Premature
mathematization would beg questions about which formalism applies.</p>
<p>What we can say prior to derivation: - IIS is not Boolean (contains
determinate states, indeterminate states, superpositions, classical
mixtures) - IIS is structured by distinguishability; the “metric” is how
distinguishable states are from each other - IIS contains all consistent
Generalized Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) as substructures (Hardy, 2001;
Chiribella et al., 2011)</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical characterization:</strong> IIS can be formally
defined as the maximal collection of states closed under
distinguishability:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{I} = \{s : D \text{ is defined
on } s \times \mathcal{I}\}\]</span></p>
<p>The derivation chain (Section 3) shows that IIS, equipped with the
inner product induced by distinguishability, has complex Hilbert space
form at the interface with Boolean actuality. This result invokes the
Masanes-Müller reconstruction theorem. The mathematical structure
<em>emerges</em> from the framework rather than being imposed on it.</p>
<p><strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> For familiar quantum
systems, IIS takes concrete form. A single qubit’s IIS is the Bloch
sphere, with the distinguishability metric <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> giving the trace distance between
states. In a two-slit experiment, the superposition state resides in IIS
with definite identity (it is determinately <span
class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span>) while lacking definite
which-path information. For composite systems, entangled states
represent correlation structures in IIS not reducible to subsystem
states. The Technical companion (§3.4) develops these examples in
detail, showing how the abstract IIS definition maps onto the standard
quantum formalism.</p>
<p>Crucially, IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 48%" />
<col style="width: 52%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>State Type</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td>Distinguishable but not resolved to definite values</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Superpositions</td>
<td>Specific indeterminate states with interference structure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mixtures</td>
<td>Probabilistic combinations without interference</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Indeterminacy is not contradiction. A state can be distinguishable
from other states without having definite values for all properties.
This distinction is essential: IIS contains genuine indeterminacy; it
does not contain contradictions.</p>
<h3 id="boolean-actuality">2.3 Boolean Actuality</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Boolean Actuality is the domain where
3FLL are fully enforced, where every proposition about the state of
affairs has exactly one truth value.</p>
<p>When something becomes actual, when it manifests as a physical state
of affairs, it must satisfy 3FLL completely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> The state is determinately what it
is</li>
<li><strong>Non-Contradiction:</strong> The state does not both have and
lack any property</li>
<li><strong>Excluded Middle:</strong> For any well-defined property, the
state either has it or does not</li>
</ul>
<p>Actuality is Boolean. Every measurement outcome is definite. Every
physical record is determinate. Every causal interaction involves states
that are one way rather than another.</p>
<p>This is not an interpretation. It is what we observe. Every
measurement, without exception, yields one outcome.</p>
<h3 id="the-interface-problem">2.4 The Interface Problem</h3>
<p>The asymmetry between IIS and Boolean actuality creates a fundamental
structural problem:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Domain</th>
<th>Structure</th>
<th>Content</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>IIS</td>
<td>Non-Boolean</td>
<td>Determinate and indeterminate states</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actuality</td>
<td>Boolean</td>
<td>Only determinate states</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>IIS contains more than actuality can accommodate. Superpositions
exist as elements of IIS but cannot exist as actualized facts. Something
must connect these domains.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>interface problem</strong>: What structure
mediates between non-Boolean IIS and Boolean actuality?</p>
<p>Any interface must satisfy three constraints derived from 3FLL:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Totality</strong> (from Excluded Middle): The interface
must be defined for all IIS states. Every state must be capable of
yielding a definite outcome.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Single-valuedness</strong> (from Non-Contradiction): No
state may yield contradictory outcomes in the same context. The
interface produces no contradictions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distinguishability-preservation</strong> (from Identity):
If states are distinguishable in IIS, their actualization patterns must
not collapse that distinction entirely.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple mathematical structures satisfy these formal constraints:
classical probability, quantum mechanics, real quantum mechanics,
quaternionic quantum mechanics, various generalized probabilistic
theories. The interface constraints alone do not uniquely determine the
structure.</p>
<h3 id="the-consistency-bridging-principle">2.5 The Consistency Bridging
Principle</h3>
<p>What constrains dynamics within IIS? Not every conceivable
transformation can be physically admissible.</p>
<p>The answer follows from the structure itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Consistency Bridging Principle (CBP):</strong> Admissible
transformations on IIS are only those for which all reachable states
can, in principle, participate in a consistent resolution to Boolean
actuality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CBP is not an additional postulate. It is an architectural
requirement. Any transformation that produced states incapable of
Boolean resolution would produce states with no path to actuality. Such
states would be physical dead ends, configurations that cannot manifest
as determinate facts.</p>
<p>CBP constrains dynamics to preserve the possibility of consistent
actualization. It does not specify <em>when</em> actualization occurs or
<em>which</em> outcome obtains. It constrains what transformations are
admissible in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Key consequence:</strong> CBP implies that fundamental
dynamics must be reversible. Irreversible dynamics destroy information;
they map distinct states to the same output. But information destruction
requires a mechanism: something must absorb or erase the distinction.
Any such mechanism would constitute additional structure beyond IIS and
3FLL. By parsimony (derived below), no such surplus structure exists at
the fundamental level. Therefore, fundamental IIS dynamics preserve
information.</p>
<h3 id="global-parsimony">2.6 Global Parsimony</h3>
<p>A principle of parsimony follows from the constitutive role of
3FLL:</p>
<p>If 3FLL constitute distinguishability, and IIS is the space
constituted by 3FLL, then actuality contains exactly what this
constitutive base generates, no more, no less.</p>
<p><strong>Global Parsimony:</strong> Actuality contains exactly the
propositions whose truth values are grounded in (3FLL + initial
conditions) and their consequences. No surplus structure exists.</p>
<p><strong>Derivation:</strong> If 3FLL constitute distinguishability,
and all physical structure presupposes distinguishability, then all
physical structure must trace to 3FLL. Consider what surplus structure
would require: structure not traceable to 3FLL would need
distinguishability from outside the only source of distinguishability.
But there is no such source available; distinguishability just is what
3FLL establish. Surplus structure is therefore incoherent. Global
Parsimony is not an aesthetic preference or methodological heuristic; it
is the closure condition on the constitutive claim itself.</p>
<p>This is a structural consequence of what “constitution” means. If
3FLL constitute the domain, the domain contains what they generate.
Propositions requiring additional grounding sources have no truthmakers
within the framework.</p>
<p>Global Parsimony has teeth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irreversible fundamental dynamics would require surplus mechanisms →
ruled out</li>
<li>Free parameters not derivable from the constitutive base → ruled out
at the fundamental level</li>
<li>Ontological additions beyond IIS structure → require justification
from the constitutive base</li>
</ul>
<p>A clarification: Global Parsimony applies to <em>fundamental</em>
structure, not to emergent or contingent physical content. The claim is
not that everything is derived from 3FLL; specific particle masses,
coupling constants, and gauge groups are empirical. The claim is that no
<em>additional foundational principles</em> beyond 3FLL are required to
ground the structure of physical law. Contingent physical content
operates within the framework that 3FLL establish; it does not require
independent metaphysical grounding.</p>
<h3 id="why-quantum-mechanics">2.7 Why Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<p>Multiple structures satisfy the formal interface constraints. What
selects quantum mechanics specifically?</p>
<p><strong>Stability.</strong></p>
<p>Classical mechanics satisfies interface constraints but produces no
stable physics: - Electrons spiral into nuclei (no stable atoms) - No
discrete energy levels (no chemistry) - No quantum tunneling (no stellar
fusion) - No identical particles (no periodic table)</p>
<p>A classical universe contains no stable matter, no chemistry, no
life, no observers to notice.</p>
<p>Real quantum mechanics (using ℝ instead of ℂ) fails local tomography:
composite system states cannot be fully determined by local
measurements. Quaternionic quantum mechanics fails compositional
consistency. Generalized probabilistic theories exceeding the Tsirelson
bound permit signaling.</p>
<p>Only complex Hilbert space quantum mechanics with unitary dynamics
and the Born rule produces: - Stable atoms (discrete energy levels from
spectral properties) - Chemistry (electron orbitals, bonding, molecular
structure) - Solid matter (Pauli exclusion prevents collapse) - Stars
(quantum tunneling enables fusion) - Observers (stable structures
capable of inquiry)</p>
<p>This is <strong>stability selection</strong>: among structures
compatible with the interface constraints, only quantum mechanics
produces stable physical existence.</p>
<p>Stability selection explains why we observe quantum mechanics:
observers require stable physical structures, and only quantum mechanics
produces them. This is an observability filter, not an ontological
derivation. The uniqueness claim, that quantum mechanics is the
<em>only</em> structure satisfying the interface constraints with
stability, rests on the mathematical reconstruction theorems
(Masanes-Müller, Hardy, Chiribella et al.), which demonstrate that
complex Hilbert space quantum mechanics is uniquely selected by the
relevant axioms. Stability selection explains why we are in a position
to observe this; the reconstruction theorems establish that there is
nothing else to observe.</p>
<p>Stability selection is not logical derivation. It does not claim
quantum mechanics is necessary. It claims quantum mechanics is
<em>observationally necessary</em>, necessary for there to be stable
structures capable of observation.</p>

distinguishability presupposes classical measurement apparatus.
Detectors yield discrete outcomes; laboratory equipment obeys 3FLL. Does
this make the derivation circular?</p>
<p><strong>The objection stated precisely:</strong> If we define the
distinguishability metric <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in
terms of measurement statistics, and measurements presuppose
3FLL-conforming apparatus, then haven’t we assumed what we claim to
derive?</p>
<p><strong>The response distinguishes observation from
explanation.</strong></p>
<p><em>Observation:</em> Measurement apparatus conforms to 3FLL.
Detectors fire or don’t fire. Outcomes are determinate.</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> Why does apparatus conform? Two answers are
available:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The operational framework is not <em>evidence</em> for LRT; it is the
<em>explanandum</em>. LRT explains why the operational framework has the
structure it does. Alternatives treat this structure as unexplained
background.</p>
<p><strong>The asymmetry argument:</strong> Consider the
conceivability-observability gap:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <em>can conceive</em> of detectors that fire and don’t fire
simultaneously</li>
<li>We <em>can imagine</em> measurement outcomes that violate Excluded
Middle</li>
<li>We <em>can entertain</em> the proposition that a particle is both
detected and not detected</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios are mentally representable. Nothing in cognition
prevents us from considering them.</p>
<p>Yet we <em>never observe</em> them. No detector in the history of
physics has ever produced a 3FLL-violating outcome. This asymmetry
requires explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Psychologism</strong> (3FLL are cognitive constraints) cannot
explain this: if 3FLL were merely how we think, we could not conceive of
their violation. But we can.</p>
<p><strong>Conventionalism</strong> (3FLL are linguistic rules) cannot
explain this: we could define “outcome” to permit contradictions; we
still would not observe them.</p>
<p><strong>LRT</strong> explains this: 3FLL are constitutive of physical
distinguishability itself. Violations are not observed because they
cannot occur—not because we cannot think them or have defined them away,
but because distinguishability presupposes logical structure.</p>
<p><strong>The conceivability claim deserves emphasis.</strong> The
assertion that we “can conceive” of 3FLL violations is not mere
hand-waving. It is backed by rigorous formal development:</p>

<p>These frameworks are not conceptual errors waiting to be corrected.
They are internally consistent formal systems with sophisticated
metatheory. One can reason validly within paraconsistent logic; the
inferences are well-defined; the semantics is rigorous.</p>
<p>The question is not whether such reasoning is <em>possible</em> (it
manifestly is). The question is whether such reasoning describes
<em>actuality</em>. And here the answer is uniformly negative. No
detector, no measurement apparatus, no physical record has ever
exhibited a paraconsistent outcome. The formal possibility is real; the
physical instantiation is absent.</p>
<p>This is precisely what LRT predicts. Formal systems are not
constrained by 3FLL because they are not physical systems; they are
abstract structures that can be specified arbitrarily. Physical
actuality <em>is</em> constrained by 3FLL because distinguishability
constitutes it. The conceivability-actuality gap is not a puzzle to be
explained away; it is the signature of 3FLL’s constitutive role.</p>
<p><strong>The circularity dissolves:</strong> Yes, the operational
framework presupposes 3FLL. This is not a bug but a feature. The
question is whether this presupposition is brute (unexplained) or
constitutive (explanatory). LRT claims the latter: 3FLL conformity of
apparatus is not coincidental background but consequence of what
distinguishability requires.</p>
<p>The derivation proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Given:</strong> Operational framework with 3FLL-conforming
measurements (observation)</li>
<li><strong>Claim:</strong> 3FLL are constitutive of distinguishability
(hypothesis)</li>
<li><strong>Derivation:</strong> From 3FLL + minimal physics → quantum
mechanics (consequence)</li>
<li><strong>Test:</strong> Framework must be consistent, predictive, and
explanatorily superior to alternatives (verification)</li>
</ol>
<p>The circularity objection mistakes the explanandum (3FLL conformity
of measurements) for a hidden assumption. LRT does not assume 3FLL
conformity—it explains it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-derivation-chain">3. The Derivation Chain</h2>
<p>This section shows that quantum mechanical structure follows from the
framework established in Section 2. The derivations rely on established
mathematical results (Masanes-Müller, Gleason, Stone) applied to the LRT
axiom structure. What LRT contributes is not new mathematics but the
grounding that explains why these axioms hold.</p>
<h3 id="the-axioms">3.1 The Axioms</h3>
<p>LRT rests on five axioms, organized by tier:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Grounding A5:</strong> Why should the interface measure be
non-contextual? Consider what contextuality of the interface measure
would mean: the same IIS state would yield different probability
distributions depending on which other measurements could have been
performed. But this would violate Identity at the interface. A state’s
probability of actualization would not be a determinate feature of that
state; it would depend on extrinsic factors. The interface would fail to
map states to definite probability assignments. Non-contextuality is
thus required by Identity: the interface must assign each state a
determinate actualization probability that is a feature of that state
itself.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> Contextuality of <em>values</em>
(Kochen-Specker) is compatible with non-contextuality of
<em>measure</em>. The distinction is essential. Values are generated at
actualization; they need not pre-exist and need not be
context-independent. But probabilities characterize the IIS state’s
disposition toward actualization. If probabilities were contextual, the
IIS state would lack determinate actualization propensities, violating
Identity for the state itself. The Kochen-Specker contextuality that
quantum mechanics exhibits concerns outcome values, not the probability
measure over those outcomes.</p>

<p>The physical axioms (A3a, A3c) represent genuine empirical input.
They are not derived from 3FLL alone. What LRT provides is the framework
within which these physical constraints yield quantum structure.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-reversibility">3.2 Deriving Reversibility</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem (Reversibility):</strong> Fundamental transformations
on IIS are information-preserving.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let T be a fundamental transformation on IIS. Suppose T is
irreversible: it maps distinct states s₁ ≠ s₂ to the same output T(s₁) =
T(s₂).</p></li>
<li><p>Information destruction requires a mechanism. If T erases the
distinction between s₁ and s₂, some physical process must absorb or
dissipate that distinction.</p></li>
<li><p>Any such mechanism constitutes structure beyond the constitutive
base (3FLL + initial conditions).</p></li>
<li><p>By Global Parsimony, no surplus structure exists at the
fundamental level.</p></li>
<li><p>By CBP, states must admit consistent Boolean resolution.
Irreversible dynamics produce states whose history becomes
unrecoverable, generating propositions (“which original state led
here?”) with no truthmaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, T must be reversible: distinct inputs map to distinct
outputs. ∎</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This derivation is genuine. Reversibility is not assumed but follows
from CBP and Global Parsimony. The physical consequence is that
fundamental dynamics preserve information, a defining feature of quantum
mechanics that other interpretations simply postulate.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-hilbert-space-structure">3.3 Deriving Hilbert Space
Structure</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem (Complex Hilbert Space):</strong> IIS, equipped with
the structure required by Axioms A1-A5 and physical constraints A3a,
A3c, admits representation as a complex Hilbert space.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p>The proof applies the Masanes-Müller reconstruction theorem
(2011).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Pairwise distinguishability implies inner product
structure.</strong></p>
<p>Axiom A2 establishes that distinguishability is a binary relation D:
IIS × IIS → [0,1]. This pairwise structure, combined with continuity
(A3a) and reversibility (derived above), induces an inner product ⟨·|·⟩
on IIS.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Local tomography selects complex
numbers.</strong></p>
<p>Three number fields could support Hilbert space structure: real (ℝ),
complex (ℂ), or quaternionic (ℍ).</p>
<ul>
<li>Real quantum mechanics: Fails local tomography. Entangled states
exist that cannot be distinguished by local measurements alone.</li>
<li>Quaternionic quantum mechanics: Fails consistent tensor product
composition. Quaternionic phases create compositional pathologies.</li>
<li>Complex quantum mechanics: Uniquely satisfies both local tomography
and compositional consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Axiom A3c (local tomography) therefore forces ℂ.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Completeness from maximality.</strong></p>
<p>IIS is defined as the maximal space of distinguishable
configurations. Maximality implies closure under limits: any Cauchy
sequence of distinguishable states has a limit that is itself
distinguishable. This gives completeness, the defining property that
makes the space a Hilbert space rather than merely an inner product
space. ∎</p>
<p><strong>Experimental confirmation:</strong> Renou et al. (2021)
tested complex vs. real quantum mechanics directly. The experiment
confirmed that locally tomographic real quantum mechanics makes
predictions distinguishable from complex quantum mechanics, and nature
follows the complex predictions.</p>
<p>This was a structural prediction of any locally tomographic
framework, including LRT. It has been confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-the-born-rule">3.4 Deriving the Born Rule</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem (Born Rule):</strong> The interface probability
measure has the form P(φ|ψ) = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|².</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p>The proof applies Gleason’s theorem (1957).</p>
<p><strong>Gleason’s Theorem:</strong> In a Hilbert space of dimension ≥
3, the only probability measure on projection operators satisfying
non-negativity, normalization, and finite additivity is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu(P) = \text{Tr}(\rho P)\]</span></p>
<p>For pure states ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and rank-1 projections P = |φ⟩⟨φ|, this
reduces to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\phi|\psi) =
|\langle\phi|\psi\rangle|^2\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Verification of premises:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Dimension ≥ 3:</em> IIS contains composite systems (entangled
states). Any composite of two systems has dimension ≥ 4.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Non-negativity:</em> From Axiom A5.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Normalization:</em> From Axiom A5.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Non-contextuality:</em> From Axiom A5: probability assigned
to an outcome depends only on state and outcome, not on other possible
outcomes in the measurement context.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All premises are satisfied. Gleason’s theorem applies. The Born rule
follows. ∎</p>
<p><strong>The bridge from distinguishability to probability:</strong>
The probability measure is not independently postulated. Given Hilbert
space structure (derived via Masanes-Müller from distinguishability
geometry) and non-contextual measure (A5, grounded in Identity),
Gleason’s theorem <em>forces</em> |ψ|² as the unique probability
measure. The mapping from distinguishability to probability is
mathematical necessity given the derived structure, not stipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Why the squared magnitude?</strong></p>
<p>The inner product ⟨ψ|φ⟩ is complex-valued. Probabilities must be real
and non-negative. The squared magnitude |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique non-negative quantity constructible from the inner
product</li>
<li>The unique power satisfying Gleason’s additivity constraints</li>
<li>Invariant under global phase transformations</li>
</ul>
<p>The exponent 2 is not chosen. It is forced by the mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="deriving-unitary-dynamics">3.5 Deriving Unitary Dynamics</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem (Schrödinger Equation):</strong> IIS dynamics take
the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial
t}|\psi\rangle = H|\psi\rangle\]</span></p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Reversibility implies unitarity.</strong></p>
<p>Section 3.2 derived that fundamental transformations preserve
information. On Hilbert space, the information-preserving
transformations are precisely the unitary (and antiunitary) operators.
Wigner’s theorem establishes this: any transformation preserving
distinguishability (inner product structure) is implemented by a unitary
or antiunitary operator.</p>
<p>Antiunitarity corresponds to time reversal. For continuous forward
evolution, unitarity applies.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Continuity implies Stone’s theorem.</strong></p>
<p>Axiom A3a requires continuous transformations. A continuous
one-parameter family of unitary operators U(t) satisfies the premises of
Stone’s theorem (1932):</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists a unique self-adjoint operator H (the Hamiltonian)</li>
<li>U(t) = e^(-iHt/ℏ)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Schrödinger equation follows immediately. ∎</p>
<h3 id="hamiltonian-and-lagrangian-structure">3.6 Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian Structure</h3>
<p>Stone’s theorem yields more than the Schrödinger equation. The
self-adjoint generator H is the <strong>Hamiltonian</strong>, the
observable corresponding to total energy. From this, standard dynamical
formalism follows.</p>
<p><strong>What Stone’s theorem provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A unique self-adjoint operator H generating the unitary group U(t) =
e^(-iHt/ℏ)</li>
<li>The spectral decomposition of H giving energy eigenstates</li>
<li>The Heisenberg picture: A(t) = U†(t)A(0)U(t)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What follows from standard physics:</strong></p>
<p>Once unitarity and the Hamiltonian are established, LRT inherits
rather than rederives the classical formalism:</p>

<p><strong>LRT’s contribution:</strong></p>
<p>LRT does not provide new derivations of Lagrangian or Hamiltonian
mechanics. What it provides is <em>grounding</em>: an explanation of why
unitary dynamics holds in the first place (reversibility from CBP +
Parsimony), which then generates the Hamiltonian via Stone’s
theorem.</p>
<p>The action principle (that physical trajectories extremize action)
receives philosophical motivation from parsimony (extremal paths require
minimal specification), but this is interpretive, not a replacement for
the standard derivation from variational principles.</p>
<p><strong>Open: Quantum Field Theory</strong></p>
<p>Extension to quantum field theory remains an open problem. QFT
requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite-dimensional field configurations in IIS</li>
<li>Relativistic (Poincaré) invariance</li>
<li>Renormalization and vacuum structure</li>
</ul>
<p>LRT’s framework is consistent with QFT but does not yet provide
independent derivations of field-theoretic structure. This is
acknowledged as a limitation and direction for future work.</p>

<p>The derivations are genuine but conditional. They show:

structure follows. The physical constraints (A3a, A3c) are not derived
from logic alone; they represent empirical input about our universe.</p>
<p>What LRT provides is the unified grounding. The axioms of

<h2 id="what-this-explains">4. What This Explains</h2>
<p>Standard quantum mechanics is empirically successful but
explanatorily silent. It tells us to use Hilbert space but not why. It
gives us the Born rule but not why |ψ|². It presents contextuality,
entanglement, and the Tsirelson bound as mathematical facts without
physical grounding.</p>
<p>LRT fills these gaps. The framework developed in Sections 2-3
provides unified explanation for phenomena that other approaches treat
as independent postulates or unexplained theorems.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-framework-addresses">4.1 What This Framework
Addresses</h3>
<p>The following phenomena receive treatment from LRT resources, ranging
from rigorous mathematical derivation to reconceptualization. The claim
is <em>unified treatment from common principles</em>, not uniform
derivation. All seventeen trace to the IIS/actuality interface
structure, unlike competing interpretations that treat them as
independent postulates or unexplained facts.</p>

<h3 id="the-measurement-problem-dissolved">4.2 The Measurement Problem
Dissolved</h3>
<p>The measurement problem asks: how does deterministic, unitary
evolution produce definite, random outcomes? When does collapse occur?
What counts as a measurement?</p>
<p>LRT dissolves rather than solves this problem.</p>
<p><strong>The dissolution:</strong> Measurement is not a dynamical
process requiring special physics. It is the interface between IIS and
Boolean actuality. The quantum state evolves unitarily in IIS. When it
interacts with a context requiring Boolean outcomes, 3FLL are enforced.
The state becomes determinate.</p>
<p>This is category transition, not collapse dynamics. The question
“when does collapse occur?” presupposes that collapse is a dynamical
process within a single domain. On LRT, measurement is a transition
between domains, from IIS structure to Boolean actuality. Asking when
this occurs is legitimate, but the answer is a physical criterion
(Section 7.1), not a dynamical mechanism. The measurement problem is
transformed, not evaded.</p>
<p><strong>The key distinction:</strong> The measurement problem is
dissolved as a <em>conceptual puzzle</em> (no special collapse dynamics
needed, no Heisenberg cut, no observer-dependence) while remaining open
as an <em>empirical question</em> (which physical criterion marks the
interface). These are different issues. The conceptual puzzle (how can
deterministic evolution produce single random outcomes?) is resolved by
recognizing measurement as category transition rather than dynamical
process. The empirical question (what physical conditions trigger
interface transition?) is legitimate and tractable, not a residual form
of the original puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>What LRT explains:</strong> - Why definite outcomes occur
(3FLL enforcement at interface) - Why outcomes are always Boolean
(actuality is Boolean by definition) - Why no special “measurement”
dynamics is needed (interface, not mechanism)</p>
<p><strong>What LRT does not explain:</strong> - The precise physical
criterion marking the interface (decoherence threshold, gravitational
criterion, information-theoretic saturation; these are empirical
questions) - Why <em>this</em> outcome rather than <em>that</em> (this
may be irreducibly stochastic)</p>
<p>The openness of the interface criterion is not evasion. LRT
constrains the answer: by Global Parsimony, any collapse mechanism must
be derivable from geometry or information capacity; it cannot introduce
free parameters. This rules out theories with arbitrary collapse rates
while remaining neutral between derivable mechanisms (gravitational
self-energy, information-theoretic saturation, decoherence thresholds).
The measurement problem is not relocated but transformed from “what
causes collapse?” to “which derivable physical criterion marks the
interface?”, an empirically tractable question.</p>
<p>The second open point, why this particular outcome, is not a failure.
No interpretation explains why a particular outcome occurs. What LRT
explains is why <em>an</em> outcome occurs and why it is always
determinate.</p>
<h3 id="entanglement-and-non-locality">4.3 Entanglement and
Non-Locality</h3>
<p>Bell’s theorem shows that quantum correlations cannot be explained by
local hidden variables. This is often presented as “spooky action at a
distance.”</p>
<p>LRT reframes this entirely.</p>
<p><strong>The reframing:</strong> There is no action at a distance
because there is no action. Entangled particles are not two things
mysteriously connected; they are one configuration in IIS with
non-factorizable structure.</p>
<p>When measurement occurs, 3FLL enforce consistency across the entire
configuration. The correlations are not caused by signaling between
particles. They are <strong>constraint satisfaction</strong>: the joint
state already satisfies 3FLL globally, and measurement reveals this
structure.</p>
<p><strong>Why no signaling:</strong> The marginal statistics at each
location are unchanged regardless of what happens at the other location.
Correlations appear only when results are compared. This is exactly what
constraint satisfaction predicts: the constraints were already global;
measurement reveals them without transmitting information.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints vs. hidden variables:</strong> Bell’s theorem
rules out local hidden <em>variables</em> (pre-existing definite
values). LRT does not posit such values. The IIS state is genuinely
indeterminate until the interface. Constraints specify relationships
between outcomes, not the outcomes themselves.</p>
<p>This distinction is crucial:</p>

<p>In LRT: - The entangled state is a single IIS configuration
satisfying 3FLL constraints - Measurement reveals which values satisfy
the constraints - No signal is needed because the constraint was
constitutive of the state, not “communicated”</p>
<p>The correlations are not explained by hidden information traveling
faster than light. They are explained by the unified structure of the
IIS state, which does not have spatial parts that need to coordinate.
The “non-locality” is in the wholeness of the state, not in any
propagation. This explains why entanglement produces correlations but
not signaling.</p>
<h4 id="worked-example-bell-state-correlations">Worked Example: Bell
State Correlations</h4>
<p>To make this concrete, we work through the Bell state <span
class="math inline">\(|\Psi^-\rangle\)</span> in complete detail,
showing how LRT explains the correlations.</p>
<p><strong>1. The State in IIS</strong></p>
<p>Consider the singlet Bell state: <span
class="math display">\[|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle -
|10\rangle)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> denote spin-up and spin-down
along the z-axis.</p>
<p><strong>IIS representation:</strong> This state is a single point in
the composite IIS for the two-particle system. Its key properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global purity:</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(|\Psi^-\rangle\)</span> is a pure state with <span
class="math inline">\(D(|\Psi^-\rangle, |\Psi^-\rangle) =
0\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Local mixedness:</strong> The reduced density matrices are
<span class="math inline">\(\rho_A = \rho_B = \frac{1}{2}I\)</span>
(maximally mixed)</li>
<li><strong>Global distinguishability:</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(D(|\Psi^-\rangle, |\Phi^+\rangle) = 1\)</span>
(perfectly distinguishable from other Bell states)</li>
</ul>
<p>The entanglement is manifest: the global state carries more
information than the sum of local states. This is correlation structure
built into IIS, not a dynamical connection between particles.</p>
<p><strong>2. Measurement Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Alice and Bob perform measurements at spacelike-separated
locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice measures spin along axis <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_A
= (\sin\theta_A\cos\phi_A, \sin\theta_A\sin\phi_A,
\cos\theta_A)\)</span></li>
<li>Bob measures spin along axis <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_B =
(\sin\theta_B\cos\phi_B, \sin\theta_B\sin\phi_B,
\cos\theta_B)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Each measurement yields Boolean outcome <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> (satisfying 3FLL at the
interface).</p>
<p><strong>3. Correlation Calculation</strong></p>
<p>The correlation function is: <span
class="math display">\[E(\hat{n}_A, \hat{n}_B) = \langle\Psi^-|\sigma_A
\cdot \hat{n}_A \otimes \sigma_B \cdot
\hat{n}_B|\Psi^-\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y,
\sigma_z)\)</span> are the Pauli matrices.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit calculation:</strong></p>
<p>For the singlet state, we use the identity: <span
class="math display">\[|\Psi^-\rangle\langle\Psi^-| = \frac{1}{4}(I
\otimes I - \sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x - \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y -
\sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z)\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore: <span class="math display">\[E(\hat{n}_A, \hat{n}_B) =
\text{Tr}\left[|\Psi^-\rangle\langle\Psi^-| \cdot (\sigma \cdot
\hat{n}_A) \otimes (\sigma \cdot \hat{n}_B)\right]\]</span></p>
<p>Expanding <span class="math inline">\((\sigma \cdot \hat{n}_A)
\otimes (\sigma \cdot \hat{n}_B)\)</span> and using <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Tr}(\sigma_i) = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Tr}(\sigma_i \sigma_j) =
2\delta_{ij}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(\hat{n}_A, \hat{n}_B) = -\hat{n}_A
\cdot \hat{n}_B = -\cos\theta\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle
between the measurement axes.</p>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong> - Parallel axes (<span
class="math inline">\(\theta = 0\)</span>): <span
class="math inline">\(E = -1\)</span> (perfect anticorrelation) -
Antiparallel axes (<span class="math inline">\(\theta = \pi\)</span>):
<span class="math inline">\(E = +1\)</span> (perfect correlation) -
Orthogonal axes (<span class="math inline">\(\theta = \pi/2\)</span>):
<span class="math inline">\(E = 0\)</span> (no correlation)</p>
<p><strong>4. CHSH Violation</strong></p>
<p>The CHSH inequality for local hidden variable theories states: <span
class="math display">\[|S| = |E(a,b) - E(a,b&#39;) + E(a&#39;,b) +
E(a&#39;,b&#39;)| \leq 2\]</span></p>
<p>Choose axes: - <span class="math inline">\(a = \hat{z}\)</span>
(Alice’s first setting) - <span class="math inline">\(a&#39; =
\hat{x}\)</span> (Alice’s second setting) - <span
class="math inline">\(b = (\hat{z} + \hat{x})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> (Bob’s
first setting, at 45°) - <span class="math inline">\(b&#39; = (\hat{z} -
\hat{x})/\sqrt{2}\)</span> (Bob’s second setting, at -45°)</p>
<p>Calculate each term using <span class="math inline">\(E =
-\cos\theta\)</span>: - <span class="math inline">\(E(a,b) = -\cos(45°)
= -1/\sqrt{2}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(E(a,b&#39;) =
-\cos(45°) = -1/\sqrt{2}\)</span> - <span
class="math inline">\(E(a&#39;,b) = -\cos(45°) = -1/\sqrt{2}\)</span> -
<span class="math inline">\(E(a&#39;,b&#39;) = -\cos(135°) =
+1/\sqrt{2}\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore: <span class="math display">\[S = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} -
\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) +
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} =
-2\sqrt{2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|S| = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.83 &gt;
2\]</span></p>
<p>The CHSH inequality is violated. Bell’s theorem concludes: no local
hidden variable theory can reproduce quantum predictions.</p>
<p><strong>5. No-Signaling Proof</strong></p>
<p>Despite the correlations, Alice cannot signal to Bob:</p>
<p><strong>Alice’s marginal probability:</strong> <span
class="math display">\[P(A = +1 | \hat{n}_A) = \text{Tr}_B\left[\langle
+_A|\rho_{AB}|+_A\rangle\right] = \text{Tr}\left[\frac{1}{2}I \cdot
|+_A\rangle\langle +_A|\right] = \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>This is independent of: - Bob’s choice of measurement axis <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_B\)</span> - Bob’s measurement outcome -
Whether Bob measures at all</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Alice’s reduced state is <span
class="math inline">\(\rho_A = \frac{1}{2}I\)</span> regardless of
anything Bob does. The correlations appear only in the joint statistics
<span class="math inline">\(P(A,B)\)</span>, never in the marginals
<span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>LRT interpretation:</strong> Each party’s local measurement
produces Boolean outcomes from the same global IIS structure. No
information propagates because both parties access the same pre-existing
correlation structure. The correlations were constitutive of the state,
not communicated.</p>

<p><strong>The LRT advantage:</strong> Correlations are not caused by
anything propagating between Alice and Bob. They are revealed by
measurements that independently actualize from the same IIS structure.
The entangled state already encodes the correlations; measurement makes
them manifest without transmitting them.</p>
<p>This worked example demonstrates the core LRT insight: entanglement
is structure in IIS, not mysterious connection in spacetime.</p>
<p><strong>Relativistic considerations:</strong> The “global constraint”
picture works naturally in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where
simultaneity is well-defined. In relativistic contexts, the constraint
is on the IIS state, not on spacetime events. The entangled state in IIS
is a single configuration; it does not have spatial parts that need to
coordinate. When measurement outcomes are registered at spacelike
separation, each outcome is locally determinate and globally consistent.
Different reference frames describe the ordering of measurements
differently, but all frames agree on the correlations, which is exactly
what we observe. A fully relativistic formulation of LRT would need to
articulate how the IIS/actuality interface respects the causal structure
of spacetime; this represents ongoing work for the framework.</p>
<h3 id="the-tsirelson-bound">4.4 The Tsirelson Bound</h3>
<p>Quantum correlations violate Bell inequalities but only up to the
Tsirelson bound of 2√2 for CHSH. Stronger correlations are
mathematically possible (PR boxes achieve 4) but not physically
realized.</p>
<p><strong>Why this bound?</strong></p>
<p>LRT explanation: The Tsirelson bound marks the maximum correlation
compatible with stable interface operation. PR boxes and other
super-quantum correlations, while satisfying no-signaling at the
single-use level, permit signaling when composed or permit computational
trivializations that destabilize physical structure.</p>
<p>The bound is not arbitrary. It is the stability limit of the
IIS-actuality interface.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation acknowledged:</strong> LRT identifies the
Tsirelson bound as the interface stability limit and provides the
<em>framework</em> within which this question becomes tractable. The
full derivation of why 2√2 <em>specifically</em> marks this limit
(rather than some other value) would require detailed
information-theoretic analysis of interface stability conditions. This
derivation is ongoing work. What LRT establishes is <em>where and
why</em> such a bound must exist; the precise value remains to be
derived from first principles.</p>
<h3 id="contextuality">4.5 Contextuality</h3>
<p>The Kochen-Specker theorem shows that quantum observables cannot all
have definite, non-contextual values prior to measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Standard framing:</strong> This is presented as a no-go
theorem, a constraint on hidden variable theories.</p>
<p><strong>LRT framing:</strong> Contextuality is not a constraint on
theories. It is a signature of the interface. Boolean values do not
exist in IIS waiting to be revealed. They are generated at the
interface, in context. Different measurement contexts actualize
different aspects of IIS structure.</p>
<p>Contextuality follows directly from the IIS/actuality distinction.
Asking “what value did the observable have before measurement?”
presupposes that Boolean values exist in IIS. They do not. They exist in
actuality, which is produced at the interface.</p>
<h3 id="wave-function-status">4.6 Wave Function Status</h3>
<p>Is the wave function real (ontic) or merely knowledge
(epistemic)?</p>
<p><strong>LRT answer:</strong> Neither, as traditionally framed. The
wave function is <strong>IIS structure</strong>: real but not
actual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real:</strong> The wave function describes genuine structure
in IIS, not mere ignorance.</li>
<li><strong>Not actual:</strong> It is not a thing in Boolean actuality
until interface transition.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ψ-structural position is compatible with the PBR theorem (which
rules out ψ-epistemic interpretations where quantum states represent
ignorance of underlying ontic states) while avoiding the claim that ψ is
a physical substance in spacetime.</p>
<h3 id="the-unification">4.7 The Unification</h3>
<p>These seventeen explanations are not independent. They follow from a
single structural insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantum mechanics is the interface between non-Boolean IIS and
Boolean actuality, constrained by 3FLL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every phenomenon in the table traces to this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measurement</strong> = interface transition</li>
<li><strong>Superposition</strong> = IIS indeterminacy</li>
<li><strong>Collapse</strong> = category change</li>
<li><strong>Entanglement</strong> = global IIS configuration</li>
<li><strong>Correlations</strong> = constraint satisfaction</li>
<li><strong>Contextuality</strong> = values generated at interface</li>
<li><strong>Born rule</strong> = unique interface probability</li>
<li><strong>Tsirelson bound</strong> = interface stability limit</li>
</ul>
<p>This unification is the primary evidence for LRT. Competing
interpretations explain some phenomena while leaving others as brute
facts. LRT explains all seventeen from common resources.</p>
<h3 id="ontic-booleanity-the-epistemic-loophole-closed">4.8 Ontic
Booleanity: The Epistemic Loophole Closed</h3>
<p>A sophisticated objection grants that <em>observed</em> outcomes obey
3FLL but suggests this might be epistemic rather than ontic: perhaps
3FLL are filters on <em>observation</em>, not constraints on
<em>reality</em>. Hidden outcome tokens might violate 3FLL while
remaining undetectable.</p>
<p>LRT closes this loophole completely.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Ontic Booleanity).</strong> Under the continuity and
path-connectedness required by quantum mechanics, every actual outcome
token satisfies 3FLL. No token—even one that never occurs with positive
probability—can violate 3FLL.</p>
<p><strong>The argument has two parts:</strong></p>
<p><em>Part I (Positive-probability tokens):</em> Any token that occurs
with positive probability must be Boolean. If a token <span
class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> violated 3FLL (say, by satisfying
both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\neg A\)</span> simultaneously), then states
assigning positive probability to <span
class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> would violate probability
normalization: <span class="math inline">\(\omega(A) + \omega(\neg A)
&gt; 1\)</span>. This contradicts the probability structure of quantum
mechanics.</p>
<p><em>Part II (Hidden zero-probability tokens):</em> Hypothetical
tokens with zero probability under all states cannot violate 3FLL
either. Here path-connectedness is crucial: pure states with <span
class="math inline">\(\omega(A) = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\omega(A) = 0\)</span> are connected by continuous
paths. Any hidden non-Boolean token would disrupt this continuity
structure. More fundamentally, the token space is <em>defined</em> by
what states can distinguish—a token outside all state supports is not a
token of the theory.</p>
<p><strong>The conclusion:</strong> 3FLL are not observer-imposed
filters but structural constraints on outcome tokens themselves. The
epistemic loophole is mathematically closed.</p>
<p>This result strengthens LRT’s core claim: the 3FLL do not merely
describe how we observe reality—they constitute what can be an actual
outcome. The continuous structure of quantum state space is incompatible
with hidden non-Boolean tokens.</p>
<p><em>For the complete proof, see Technical companion Theorem
7.1.</em></p>

<p><strong>The parsimony comparison:</strong></p>
<p>MWI’s ontology is staggering: every quantum event spawns entire
universes. Defenders respond that branches are not “added” but entailed
by refusing to postulate collapse. However, the asymmetry with LRT is
fundamental. MWI’s branches are entailed by <em>denying</em> something
observation suggests (single outcomes). LRT’s 3FLL are
<em>presupposed</em> by any coherent discourse, including MWI’s own
formulation. MWI adds branch realism to avoid accepting what every
measurement displays; LRT makes explicit what every theory already
assumes at the metalevel. The parsimony difference is not between “one
world” and “many worlds” but between recognizing presuppositions and
multiplying entities to evade observations.</p>
<p>Bohmian mechanics adds hidden variables that are in principle
unobservable plus explicitly nonlocal dynamics.</p>
<p>GRW adds new physics with unexplained parameters.</p>
<p>LRT adds nothing beyond what is already presupposed. The 3FLL are
assumed by every theory at the metalevel. Making them explicit and
showing they do physical work is not adding ontology; it is recognizing
what was already there.</p>

<p><strong>The MWI problem is severe.</strong> If all branches are
equally real, what does “probability” mean? The Deutsch-Wallace
derivation uses decision-theoretic arguments: a rational agent
<em>should</em> weight branches by |ψ|². But this is normative, not
physical. It doesn’t explain why |ψ|² tracks anything about reality.</p>
<p><strong>LRT’s derivation is rigorous.</strong> Gleason’s theorem
proves |ψ|² is the unique probability measure on Hilbert space
satisfying minimal conditions. The derivation is mathematical, not
normative. The conditions (non-negativity, normalization,
non-contextuality) are grounded in the interface structure.</p>

<p><strong>The core difference:</strong></p>
<p>MWI: We observe one outcome because we’re in one branch, but all
branches are equally real. This requires explaining why Born rule gives
branch weights, what “probability” means when all outcomes occur, and
why we should believe in unobservable branches.</p>
<p>LRT: We observe one outcome because actuality is Boolean.
Non-Contradiction and Excluded Middle enforce single, determinate
outcomes. No additional explanation needed; single actuality follows
from 3FLL.</p>
<p>The asymmetry is fundamental: MWI introduces branch realism to avoid
accepting what every measurement displays (single outcomes), while LRT
makes explicit what every theory already presupposes (3FLL). MWI and LRT
thus differ not just in ontology but in methodology: one multiplies
entities, the other recognizes presuppositions.</p>

<p><strong>The complex numbers result:</strong></p>
<p>LRT, via local tomography (A3c), requires that quantum mechanics use
complex rather than real amplitudes. This structural requirement
(independently established by reconstruction theorems) was
experimentally confirmed by Renou et al. (2021), who designed an
experiment distinguishing complex from real quantum mechanics. Nature
followed the complex predictions. While LRT did not generate this
prediction independently of reconstruction theorems, the experimental
confirmation validates the framework’s structural commitments.</p>
<h3 id="currently-testable-predictions">6.2 Currently Testable
Predictions</h3>
<p><strong>Prediction 1: Collapse parameters must be
derivable.</strong></p>
<p>If objective collapse occurs (as in GRW-type models), LRT constrains
the mechanism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any collapse parameter not derivable from geometry or information
capacity would constitute surplus structure, violating Global
Parsimony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GRW introduces parameters λ (collapse rate) and a (localization
width) as primitives. If collapse is confirmed with these as free
parameters (not derivable from existing physical constants), LRT
requires revision.</p>
<p>Conversely, if collapse rates follow from gravitational self-energy
(Penrose-Diósi) or information-theoretic bounds, LRT is supported.</p>

<p>This scaling explains why microscopic systems exhibit quantum
behavior while macroscopic systems appear classical. The interface
transition rate scales with system complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction 2: No recoherence after
actualization.</strong></p>
<p>LRT treats measurement as category transition. Once an outcome has
produced a stable macroscopic record, the other “branches” were never
actual; there is nothing to recohere.</p>
<p>MWI permits recoherence in principle (given sufficient control). LRT
forbids it for actualized outcomes.</p>
<p>This is difficult to test directly but represents a genuine
ontological difference with empirical implications in extreme
regimes.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction 3: Structural fine-tuning is exact.</strong></p>
<p>LRT predicts that perturbations to quantum structure destroy stable
physics entirely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove complex numbers → No stable interference</li>
<li>Alter unitarity → Probability non-conservation</li>
<li>Change Born exponent → No valid probability measure</li>
<li>Exceed Tsirelson bound → Signaling permitted</li>

<p><strong>Assessment of falsifier categories:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Already tested (1-4, 7-8):</strong> Falsifiers 1-4 and 7-8
have been tested extensively. Born rule confirmed to 10⁻⁵. Tsirelson
bound holds. Real QM ruled out (2021). Bell and Kochen-Specker
violations confirmed. LRT passes.</p>
<p><strong>Currently testable (11-12):</strong> Bekenstein bound tests
and collapse mechanism experiments are active research areas. These
represent genuine empirical risk for LRT.</p>
<p><strong>Foundational (5-6, 9-10):</strong> These falsifiers concern
logical structure presupposed by all empirical science. Observing a
physical dialetheia or non-Boolean outcome would not merely refute LRT;
it would challenge the foundations of scientific inquiry itself. These
are “in principle” falsifiers that establish LRT’s logical commitments,
not practical test conditions. No such observations exist or are
expected.</p>
<p><strong>Note on shared falsifiers:</strong> Several falsifiers (Born
rule, Tsirelson bound, no-signaling) are shared with standard quantum
mechanics. This is appropriate: LRT <em>predicts</em> standard QM, so
falsifiers of standard QM are falsifiers of LRT. What distinguishes LRT
is that it <em>explains</em> what it predicts rather than postulating
it. The distinctive LRT predictions concern structural requirements
(complex numbers, derivable collapse parameters) and the impossibility
of certain extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Critical falsifier: Fundamental information loss.</strong>
The derivation of unitary dynamics (Section 3.5) rests on the
Consistency Bridging Principle and Global Parsimony, which require that
fundamental dynamics preserve information. This explicitly stakes LRT on
the resolution of the Black Hole Information Paradox. If Hawking
radiation is confirmed to be truly thermal with fundamental information
loss (non-unitary black hole evaporation), this directly falsifies LRT’s
derivation of the Schrödinger equation. Current theoretical evidence
(AdS/CFT correspondence, Page curve derivations) favors information
preservation, but this remains an open empirical and theoretical
question. LRT’s commitment to unitarity is principled, not evasive:
information destruction would require a mechanism constituting surplus
structure beyond the constitutive base, violating Global Parsimony.</p>
<h3 id="what-lrt-does-not-predict">6.4 What LRT Does Not Predict</h3>

<p>Only LRT and GRW make testable predictions and specify falsification
conditions. This is what distinguishes physical theories from
interpretive frameworks.</p>
<p>LRT’s advantage over GRW: LRT constrains collapse mechanisms rather
than postulating specific parameters. If GRW’s parameters are confirmed
as free (not derivable), GRW is confirmed but LRT requires revision. If
collapse parameters are derivable from geometry or information theory,
both are supported but LRT’s parsimony constraint is vindicated.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="open-questions-and-conclusion">7. Open Questions and
Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="what-remains-open">7.1 What Remains Open</h3>
<p>LRT does not answer every question. Honest accounting requires
identifying what is not yet resolved.</p>
<p><strong>The interface criterion:</strong></p>
<p>LRT establishes that measurement is category transition from IIS to
Boolean actuality. It does not specify the precise physical criterion
marking this transition.</p>
<p>Candidates include: - Decoherence thresholds (environmental
entanglement) - Gravitational self-energy (Penrose-Diósi) -
Information-theoretic saturation (Bekenstein-type bounds) -
Thermodynamic irreversibility</p>
<p>These are empirical questions. Section 6.2 identified experiments
currently testing them. LRT constrains the answer (no free parameters)
but does not determine it.</p>
<p><strong>Why this outcome?</strong></p>
<p>LRT explains why measurement yields <em>a</em> definite Boolean
outcome. It does not explain why <em>this particular</em> outcome rather
than another.</p>
<p>This may be irreducibly stochastic. The Born rule gives
probabilities; there may be no deeper fact about why a specific outcome
occurs. If so, this is not a failure of LRT but a feature of physical
reality.</p>
<p>No interpretation explains individual outcome selection. MWI claims
all outcomes occur. Bohmian mechanics makes selection deterministic but
with unknowable initial conditions. GRW makes it stochastic. LRT is
honest that this question is open.</p>
<p><strong>The relativistic interface:</strong></p>
<p>LRT explains entanglement as global constraint satisfaction rather
than causal signaling. This works naturally in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, where simultaneity is well-defined. However, a fully
relativistic formulation requires articulating how the IIS/actuality
interface respects the causal structure of spacetime.</p>
<p>The challenge: “global constraint” might appear to presuppose a
reference frame, while Special Relativity has no universal “now.” The
resolution lies in recognizing that the constraint is on the IIS state
itself (which is a single configuration without spatial parts needing
coordination), not on spacetime events. Different reference frames
describe measurement orderings differently, but all frames agree on the
correlations.</p>
<p>A Lorentz-invariant formulation of the interface, likely using
algebraic quantum field theory where local observables respect causal
diamond structure, is required for full theoretical completeness. This
represents ongoing work analogous in importance to the interface
criterion problem.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum field theory:</strong></p>
<p>Section 3.6 noted that QFT extension remains incomplete. LRT’s
framework is consistent with quantum field theory but does not yet
provide independent derivations of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relativistic field structure</li>
<li>Renormalization</li>
<li>Vacuum properties</li>
<li>Gauge symmetries</li>
</ul>
<p>However, explicit derivation may not be required. If 3FLL function as
a global constraint field rather than merely interface constraints, QFT
inherits logical grounding directly. The quantum mechanical core of QFT
(complex Hilbert space/Fock space, unitary S-matrix, Boolean measurement
outcomes, the Born rule) operates within the same constraint structure
that LRT establishes. The specifically field-theoretic features (which
fields, which gauge groups, which particle content) represent contingent
physical content operating within the constraint field, analogous to how
specific triangles operate within Euclidean geometry without being
derived from its axioms.</p>
<p>This perspective suggests that renormalization might be understood as
constraint enforcement: the infinities arising in naive QFT calculations
violate distinguishability (infinite quantities are not well-defined),
and renormalization removes these violations to restore 3FLL
compliance.</p>
<p>The implications of treating 3FLL as a global constraint field (for
understanding gauge symmetries, for the relationship between logical and
spacetime structure, and for quantum gravity) constitute a direction for
future work.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum gravity:</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between LRT and gravity is undeveloped. Intriguing
possibilities exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spacetime might emerge from distinguishability structure in IIS</li>
<li>The holographic principle suggests information-theoretic foundations
for geometry</li>
<li>The Bekenstein bound connects entropy to area in Planck units</li>
</ul>
<p>These connections are suggestive but not yet rigorous. Quantum
gravity remains the major open problem in fundamental physics; LRT does
not solve it.</p>
<p><strong>The action-complexity conjecture:</strong></p>
<p>The original development of LRT proposed a conjecture:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S = \hbar \cdot C\]</span></p>
<p>relating physical action S to informational complexity C, with ℏ as
the conversion factor.</p>
<p>This conjecture is motivated by: - The Bekenstein bound (entropy
proportional to area in Planck units) - Black hole thermodynamics - The
Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit</p>
<p>However, the conjecture remains speculative. It has not generated
testable predictions distinct from existing physics. If developed
further, it might yield novel empirical content. Currently, it is a
research direction, not an established result.</p>

<p><strong>Refining the Status of “Physical Inputs”:</strong></p>
<p>In the derivation of Quantum Field Theory (see QFT companion paper),
we categorize features like Lorentz Invariance and Microcausality as
“Tier 2/3 Inputs”. It is crucial to distinguish the <em>methodological
status</em> of these inputs from their <em>ontological status</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Methodologically</strong>, we treat them as inputs to
maintain rigor where a complete mathematical derivation from 3FLL is not
yet finalized. We honestly acknowledge the current gap between the
abstract logic of distinguishability and the specific geometry of
spacetime.</p>
<p><strong>Ontologically</strong>, however, LRT asserts that these are
not independent variables. Under <strong>Global Parsimony</strong>, the
universe cannot contain arbitrary symmetries. Thus, these inputs
function as <strong>pending derivations</strong>: logical placeholders
for constraints that are necessary to maintain 3FLL compliance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Local Tomography</strong> is not an arbitrary rule; it is
the stability constraint that prevents the logical incoherence of
“globally distinct but locally identical” states. Although real QM
permits globally distinct states with identical marginals (e.g., |Φ⁺⟩
and |Φ⁻⟩ both give ρ_A = ρ_B = I/2), such states would violate Global
Parsimony: the same local statistics would correspond to two
metaphysically distinct global configurations with no additional
distinguishable consequences—surplus ontological structure forbidden by
the truthmaker requirement of 3FLL.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lorentz Invariance</strong> is treated as an input, but
LRT conjectures that the Poincaré group will ultimately be shown to be
the unique isometry group that preserves the distinguishability metric D
across all physically admissible frames of reference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction is not between “logical” and “empirical,” but between
“derived now” and “derivable in principle.”</p>
<p><strong>What LRT Does Not Explain:</strong> - Why there is something
rather than nothing - Why 3FLL rather than some other logical structure
- Why THESE quantum fields, masses, constants - The arrow of time
(beyond interface structure) - The specific interface criterion
(empirical question)</p>
<h3 id="the-core-contribution">7.4 The Core Contribution</h3>
<p>LRT’s central contribution is answering a question other
interpretations do not address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why does quantum mechanics have its specific
structure?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between the space of
distinguishable configurations (IIS) and Boolean actuality, given that
the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic are constitutive of physical
distinguishability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains: - Why Hilbert space (pairwise distinguishability +
physical constraints) - Why complex numbers (local tomography) - Why the
Born rule (Gleason’s theorem on the interface) - Why unitary dynamics
(reversibility from CBP + Parsimony) - Why contextuality (values
generated at interface) - Why Bell correlations without signaling
(global constraint satisfaction) - Why the Tsirelson bound (interface
stability limit)</p>
<p>Other interpretations postulate quantum structure and interpret it.
LRT explains why that structure obtains.</p>
<h3 id="the-wager">7.5 The Wager</h3>
<p>LRT offers a wager:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The deepest structure of physical reality is not contingent but
constrained: constrained by the conditions under which anything can be
distinguished from anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is correct: - The “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics”
dissolves (mathematics and physics share logical roots) - The structure
of quantum mechanics is not arbitrary but necessary for stable physics -
The foundations of physics connect to the foundations of logic and
information</p>
<p>If this is wrong: - Quantum structure is brute contingency, not
explained by deeper principles - The success of 3FLL across all physics
is coincidence or cognitive artifact - Some alternative interpretation
better accounts for the evidence</p>
<p>The wager is testable. Section 6 specified conditions that would
refute LRT. The framework takes intellectual risk.</p>

<p><strong>Near-term (tractable with current methods):</strong> 1. Test
S = ℏC in simple models (qubit systems) 2. Develop relativistic LRT
using algebraic QFT 3. Formalize the interface category mathematically
4. Improve sensitivity of collapse mechanism experiments</p>
<p><strong>Medium-term (requires new developments):</strong> 5. Derive
local tomography from 3FLL (would strengthen foundations) 6. Connect LRT

at increasing mass scales 8. Investigate tensor network structure of
actualizable states</p>
<p><strong>Long-term (speculative):</strong> 9. Derive specific field
content from LRT + cosmological principles 10. Unify LRT with spacetime
emergence 11. Resolve the arrow of time within LRT</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">7.8 Conclusion</h3>
<p>Every physical measurement ever conducted has yielded exactly one
outcome: self-identical, non-contradictory, determinate. This holds
despite a century of quantum mechanics where violations were actively
sought.</p>
<p>Logic Realism Theory explains this pattern. The Three Fundamental
Laws of Logic are not cognitive conventions but ontological constraints
constitutive of physical distinguishability. Quantum mechanics is the
unique stable structure at the interface between non-Boolean possibility
and Boolean actuality.</p>
<p>The framework derives rather than postulates: complex Hilbert space
from local tomography, the Born rule from Gleason’s theorem, unitary
dynamics from information preservation. One structural prediction (that
quantum mechanics requires complex amplitudes) has been experimentally
confirmed.</p>
<p>Twelve explicit conditions would falsify the theory. Experiments
currently underway test its predictions about collapse mechanisms. This
is what physical theories do: explain, predict, and risk refutation.</p>
<p>The competing interpretations either refuse ontological commitment,
require infinite unobservable worlds, introduce unexplained nonlocal
mechanisms, or abandon objectivity. LRT maintains realism, locality, and
parsimony while explaining what others postulate.</p>
<p>The “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics” in physics is
revealed as an illusion caused by viewing physical laws as contingent.
By strictly enforcing Global Parsimony, LRT shows that fundamental
physical constraints—from the Born Rule to Special Relativity—are the
unique mathematical solutions necessary to maintain the Three
Fundamental Laws of Logic at the interface of possibility and actuality.
There is no “Bit” without the “Fit” of logical consistency.</p>
<p>It from bit. Bit from fit.</p>
<p>Wheeler’s insight was that information is fundamental: physical
reality emerges from yes/no questions. LRT adds: the bit itself, the
fundamental unit of distinction, is not primitive. It emerges from the
fit between logical structure (3FLL) and physical actuality. Quantum
mechanics is the mathematics of that fit.</p>
