**Title**: Logic Realism Theory: Position Paper

**Authors**:
- Longmire, James D. (ORCID: 0009-0009-1383-7698)

**Description**:
Position paper for Logic Realism Theory (LRT). Argues that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Determinate Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) function as ontological constraints on physical instantiation, not merely descriptive principles. Establishes the L₃ framework, the vehicle/content distinction, and the formal definition A_Ω = L₃(I_∞). Serves as the foundational document for the LRT programme.

## 2. Hilbert Space Derivation

**File**: `pdf/20251231_LRT_Hilbert_Space_Derivation.pdf`

**Title**: Complex Hilbert Space from Determinate Identity: A Logic-Realist Derivation

**Authors**:
- Longmire, James D. (ORCID: 0009-0009-1383-7698)

**Description**:
Derives complex Hilbert space structure from Determinate Identity (Id). Shows that Id forces local tomography (composite states determined by marginals), continuous reversible dynamics, and permits entanglement—the Masanes-Müller reconstruction axioms. Complex field emerges as the unique number system satisfying these constraints. Establishes the mathematical arena for quantum mechanics from logical principles.

## 3. Born Rule Paper

**File**: `pdf/20251231_LRT_Born_Rule_Paper.pdf`

**Title**: The Born Rule from Determinate Identity

**Authors**:
- Longmire, James D. (ORCID: 0009-0009-1383-7698)

**Description**:
Derives the Born rule (p = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|²) from Determinate Identity via vehicle-weight invariance. The measure over measurement outcomes belongs to the physical situation (vehicle), not representational choice (content). If this measure varied with basis decomposition, the physical situation would be indeterminate. This constraint forces the additivity and non-contextuality that Gleason's theorem requires, yielding the Born rule as the unique compatible measure.

## 4. QFT Statistics Paper

**File**: `pdf/20251231_LRT_QFT_Statistics_Paper.pdf`

**Title**: Quantum Statistics from Determinate Identity: A Logic-Realist Derivation of the Symmetrization Postulate

**Authors**:
- Longmire, James D. (ORCID: 0009-0009-1383-7698)

**Description**:
Derives the symmetrization postulate for identical particles from Determinate Identity. Non-symmetric states attribute distinguishable identity to indistinguishable particles, violating Id. Only symmetric (bosonic) and antisymmetric (fermionic) sectors are L₃-admissible. Fock space structure follows as consequence. Addresses spin-statistics connection and rules out parastatistics.

## 5. GR Extension

**File**: `pdf/20251231_LRT_GR_Extension.pdf`

**Title**: Spacetime from Determinate Identity: A Logic-Realist Approach to General Relativity

**Authors**:
- Longmire, James D. (ORCID: 0009-0009-1383-7698)

**Description**:
Programmatic exploration of spacetime structure from L₃ constraints. Temporal ordering emerges from joint inadmissibility of configurations; Lorentzian signature is forced by asymmetry between timelike and spacelike separation; closed timelike curves are excluded by identity preservation; singularities cannot destroy identity-constituting information. Sketches arguments rather than providing complete derivations.
