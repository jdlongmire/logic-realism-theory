## Abstract

The companion papers have established Logic Realism Theory (LRT) as a philosophical thesis (Paper 1), a physical interpretation of quantum mechanics (Paper 2), and a rigorous mathematical framework (Paper 3). This paper completes the program by examining the empirical status of LRT. We distinguish three categories: (1) **retrodictions** - phenomena that standard quantum mechanics predicts but LRT uniquely *explains*; (2) **predictions** - testable claims that follow from LRT, including the Action-Complexity Equivalence conjecture S = ℏC; and (3) **falsifiers** - observations that would refute LRT. We show that LRT is not merely an interpretation but an empirically grounded framework that makes contact with ongoing experiments in quantum foundations. The theory's predictions concerning real vs. complex quantum mechanics have already been confirmed (Renou et al., 2021), and its predictions concerning interface mechanisms will be tested within the next decade.

**Keywords:** quantum foundations, empirical predictions, falsifiability, Born rule, Bell inequalities, structural fine-tuning, action-complexity correspondence

## 1. Introduction

A theoretical framework without empirical content is metaphysics at best, speculation at worst. Logic Realism Theory makes strong claims: that the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL) are constitutive of physical reality, that quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality, and that this explains the otherwise mysterious features of quantum theory.

Such claims demand empirical grounding. This paper provides it.

We organize the empirical content of LRT into three categories:

**Retrodictions:** Phenomena already confirmed that LRT explains more deeply than standard quantum mechanics. These are not novel predictions but provide explanatory unification.

**Predictions:** Testable claims that follow from LRT's specific commitments, especially the Action-Complexity Equivalence (S = ℏC) and the structural fine-tuning thesis.

**Falsifiers:** Possible observations that would refute LRT. A theory that cannot be wrong cannot be scientific.

The goal is not merely to show that LRT is consistent with observation - any interpretation of quantum mechanics can claim that. The goal is to show that LRT makes specific claims about the structure of reality that are, in principle and in practice, testable.

## 2. Retrodictions: What LRT Explains

### 2.1 The Explanatory Gap in Standard Quantum Mechanics

Standard quantum mechanics (QM) is empirically successful but explanatorily silent. It tells us:

- Use Hilbert space (but not why)
- Apply the Born rule |ψ|² (but not why)
- Accept contextuality (but not why)
- Expect Bell violations (but not why)

LRT fills these gaps. It does not change the predictions but grounds them in deeper structure.

### 2.2 Retrodiction Table

| Phenomenon | Standard QM | LRT Explanation |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Born rule is |ψ|² exactly** | Postulate | Gleason's theorem + non-contextual interface (Axiom 5) - the *unique* probability measure on Hilbert space |
| **Hilbert space is complex (not real or quaternionic)** | Postulate | Local tomography (Axiom 3c) forces ℂ; alternatives lack compositional structure |
| **Kochen-Specker contextuality** | Theorem (unexplained) | Interface signature - Boolean values are generated at interface, not pre-existing in IIS |
| **Bell inequality violations** | Theorem (unexplained) | 3FLL operate as global constraint field; correlations are constraint satisfaction, not signaling |
| **Tsirelson bound (2√2)** | Theorem | Maximum correlation compatible with stable interface; exceeding it allows signaling |
| **No-cloning theorem** | Theorem | Distinguishability preservation in IIS; copying would violate information structure |
| **Uncertainty relations** | Theorem | Non-commuting observables = incompatible partitions of IIS; cannot simultaneously actualize |
| **Identical particles** | Postulate | Same excitation mode of distinguishability field; identity is constitutive, not coincidental |
| **Quantization (discrete spectra)** | From dynamics | Boolean grain of actuality; minimal distinguishability unit is the bit |
| **Decoherence** | Derived | Interface approach mechanism; environmental entanglement enforces pointer basis |
| **Wave-particle duality** | "Complementarity" | IIS state (wave-like) vs. actualized outcome (particle-like); different domains |
| **Superposition** | Postulate | IIS is non-Boolean; superposition is the pre-actualization state |
| **Entanglement without signaling** | "Peaceful coexistence" | Global constraint, not causal connection; 3FLL enforce consistency without communication |
| **Quantum Zeno effect** | Derived | Repeated interface → frozen IIS evolution; measurement is active, not passive |
| **Measurement "disturbance"** | Postulate | Interface generates Boolean values; no pre-existing values to "disturb" |
| **State collapse** | Postulate (problematic) | Category transition from IIS to actuality; not a dynamical process |
| **Preferred basis problem** | Unresolved in MWI | Einselection + interface structure determines which partition actualizes |

### 2.3 The Depth of Explanation

Standard QM presents these as brute facts or mathematical consequences without physical interpretation. LRT provides a unified explanation:

**All of these phenomena follow from the interface structure between non-Boolean IIS and Boolean actuality, constrained by 3FLL.**

This is not ad hoc. The same explanatory resources (3FLL, IIS, interface, distinguishability) ground all 17 phenomena. The unification is the evidence.

## 3. Already Confirmed: Complex Quantum Mechanics

### 3.1 The Prediction

LRT, via Axiom 3(c) (Local Tomography), predicts that the number field of quantum mechanics must be ℂ (complex numbers), not ℝ (reals) or ℍ (quaternions).

**Why:** Local tomography requires that composite systems be fully characterized by local measurements on their parts. Real quantum mechanics fails this: there exist real quantum states of composite systems that cannot be distinguished by local measurements alone.

### 3.2 The Test

Renou et al. (2021) designed an experiment to distinguish real and complex quantum mechanics using entanglement swapping:

**Setup:** 
- Two independent sources each produce entangled pairs
- Pairs are distributed to three parties: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Alice and Charlie each receive one particle from different sources
- Bob receives one particle from each source and performs a joint measurement
- Correlations between Alice, Bob, and Charlie are measured

**The key insight:** In real quantum mechanics, certain correlations are impossible because real numbers lack the phase structure of complex numbers. Complex QM predicts stronger correlations.

### 3.3 The Result

The experiment observed correlations that **ruled out real quantum mechanics** with high statistical significance.

**Status:** LRT prediction confirmed.

This is not a trivial result. Real quantum mechanics is mathematically consistent; it simply does not describe our universe. LRT explains why: local tomography (Axiom 3c) is required for compositional physics, and local tomography forces complex numbers.

## 4. Current Experiments: Interface Mechanism

### 4.1 The Open Question

LRT specifies that Boolean actuality is enforced at an interface but does not uniquely determine the physical mechanism. Several candidates exist:

| Mechanism | Proponent | Physical Criterion |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Decoherence** | Zurek, Zeh | Environmental entanglement |
| **Gravity-induced collapse** | Penrose, Diósi | Gravitational self-energy threshold |
| **Spontaneous localization** | GRW, Pearle | Stochastic hits at rate λ |
| **Thermodynamic** | Various | Irreversibility / entropy production |

LRT is compatible with any of these. The question is empirical.

### 4.2 Penrose-Diósi Model

**Prediction:** Superposition collapses when gravitational self-energy exceeds threshold:

$$\tau \sim \frac{\hbar}{E_G}$$

where E_G is the gravitational self-energy of the superposition:

$$E_G = G \int \frac{[\rho_1(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_2(\mathbf{r})][\rho_1(\mathbf{r'}) - \rho_2(\mathbf{r'})]}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} d^3r \, d^3r'$$

**Testable predictions:**

| System | Mass | Superposition size | Predicted τ |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Molecule (10⁴ amu) | 10⁻²³ kg | 1 μm | ~10⁵ s |
| Nanoparticle (10⁹ amu) | 10⁻¹⁸ kg | 100 nm | ~10⁻² s |
| Micromirror (10¹⁴ amu) | 10⁻¹³ kg | 10 nm | ~10⁻⁷ s |

### 4.3 Planned Experiments

**MAQRO (Macroscopic Quantum Resonators in Orbit):**
- ESA mission proposal
- Test superposition of ~10⁹ amu particles in space
- Microgravity eliminates decoherence from support structures
- Timeline: Under development

**Optomechanical tests:**
- Ground-based experiments with nanomechanical oscillators
- Create superpositions of center-of-mass motion
- Monitor decoherence rates vs. mass
- Status: Ongoing (Vienna, Delft, others)

**Interferometry:**
- Large-molecule interferometry (Vienna)
- Current record: ~25,000 amu molecules
- Goal: Push to 10⁶+ amu to probe Penrose regime

### 4.4 What Results Would Tell Us

| Observation | Interpretation for LRT |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Collapse rate matches Penrose-Diósi | Gravity is interface mechanism |
| Collapse rate matches GRW | Spontaneous localization is mechanism |
| No collapse beyond decoherence | Decoherence alone is interface marker |
| Unexpected scaling | Novel interface physics |

**LRT's role:** Whatever is found, LRT provides the interpretation. The mechanism is the physical marker of category transition from IIS to Boolean actuality.

### 4.5 GRW Heating Tests

**Prediction:** GRW spontaneous localization injects energy:

$$P \sim \lambda \cdot N \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{m a^2} \approx 10^{-25} \text{ W/nucleon}$$

**Test:** Precision calorimetry of ultra-cold systems.

**Status:** Current sensitivity ~10⁻²² W. Need three more orders of magnitude.

---

## 5. Novel Predictions: The Action-Complexity Equivalence

### 5.1 Conjecture 12.1 Restated

**Conjecture (S = ℏC):** There exists a fundamental equivalence between physical action and informational complexity:

$$S = \hbar \cdot C$$

where S is action and C is complexity (in bits).

This conjecture, introduced in Paper 3, generates novel testable predictions.

### 5.2 Prediction: Quantum Speed Limits

**Statement:** The time required to transition between quantum states is bounded by their complexity difference:

$$\tau \geq \frac{\hbar \cdot \Delta C}{\Delta E}$$

**Standard form (Margolus-Levitin):**

$$\tau \geq \frac{\pi \hbar}{2 E}$$

**Connection:** If S = ℏC, then the number of distinguishable operations is bounded by available action. The Margolus-Levitin theorem becomes a complexity bound.

**Status:** Margolus-Levitin is confirmed. The complexity interpretation is testable in quantum computing contexts by measuring state-transition times vs. circuit complexity.

### 5.3 Prediction: Landauer Limit Is Exact

**Statement:** The minimum energy to erase one bit of information is:

$$E_{erase} = k_B T \ln 2$$

**Standard status:** Landauer limit is established but often treated as approximate.

**LRT prediction:** If S = ℏC, the Landauer limit is **exact** - erasure of one bit requires exactly this action.

**Test:** Precision measurements of bit erasure in nanoscale systems.

**Recent experiments:** Bérut et al. (2012), Jun et al. (2014) confirmed Landauer limit to ~10%.

**LRT prediction:** Continued improvement will show exact saturation, not approximate.

### 5.4 Prediction: Bekenstein Bound Is Exact

**Statement:** Maximum information in a region is bounded by:

$$S \leq \frac{2\pi k_B E R}{\hbar c}$$

**LRT interpretation:** Spatial regions have maximum distinguishability capacity. The Bekenstein bound is not just thermodynamic but logical - it reflects the maximum number of bits that can be actualized in a region.

**Consequence:** Black hole entropy S_BH = A/4ℓ_P² represents the maximum complexity for that horizon area.

### 5.5 Prediction: Computation-Energy Equivalence

**Statement:** The maximum number of operations per unit energy is:

$$\dot{N}_{max} = \frac{2E}{\pi\hbar}$$

**Test:** Ultimate limits of quantum computation.

**Status:** Margolus-Levitin established this. LRT grounds it: operations = bit flips = complexity changes = action consumption.

### 5.6 Prediction: Black Hole Information

**Statement:** Information is preserved through black hole evaporation because distinguishability (constituted by 3FLL) cannot be destroyed.

**Consequence:** Black hole complementarity or some information-preserving mechanism must hold.

**Status:** Theoretical. Hawking radiation calculations support information preservation.

---

## 6. Novel Predictions: Structural Fine-Tuning

### 6.1 The Core Claim

LRT claims quantum mechanics is the **unique stable interface** between IIS and Boolean actuality. This implies that alternatives to quantum structure are not merely different but pathological.

### 6.2 Prediction: No Alternative Frameworks Produce Stable Physics

| Alternative | LRT Prediction | Pathology |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Real quantum mechanics (ℝ) | Ruled out | No local tomography; ✓ confirmed 2021 |
| Quaternionic quantum mechanics (ℍ) | Ruled out | No local tomography; non-associative issues |
| Non-linear quantum mechanics | Ruled out | Superluminal signaling possible |
| Born rule with p ≠ 2 | Ruled out | Gleason: no consistent probability measure |
| Super-quantum correlations | Ruled out | Violate no-signaling or stability |
| Hidden variable theories (local) | Ruled out | Bell's theorem; ✓ confirmed |
| Non-contextual hidden variables | Ruled out | Kochen-Specker; ✓ confirmed |

### 6.3 Prediction: Tsirelson Bound Is Exact

**Statement:** Quantum correlations saturate the Tsirelson bound (2√2 for CHSH) and never exceed it.

**Why:** The Tsirelson bound marks the maximum correlation compatible with:
1. No-signaling
2. Stable composition of systems
3. Information-theoretic consistency

Post-quantum theories that exceed Tsirelson would violate stability requirements.

**Test:** Continued precision Bell tests.

**Status:** All experiments confirm Tsirelson bound exactly. No violations observed.

### 6.4 Prediction: Born Rule Precision

**Statement:** The Born rule |ψ|² holds exactly, not approximately.

**Why:** Gleason's theorem allows no alternatives for dim ≥ 3. Any deviation would indicate non-Hilbert structure.

**Test:** Precision measurements of quantum probabilities.

**Status:** Born rule confirmed to ~10⁻⁵ precision. LRT predicts continued confirmation at all precision levels.

### 6.5 Prediction: No "Post-Quantum" Theories

**Statement:** There exists no empirically adequate theory that:
- Is more non-local than QM (exceeds Tsirelson)
- Has different probability rules than Born
- Has non-contextual hidden variables
- Uses different number field than ℂ

**Why:** Such theories would either violate 3FLL constraints or fail to produce stable physics.

**Consequence:** Quantum mechanics is not a waystation to deeper theory (in terms of structure). The structure is fixed; only parameters (masses, couplings) might have deeper explanation.

---

## 7. Novel Predictions: 3FLL as Global Constraint

### 7.1 Prediction: No Physical Dialetheia

**Statement:** No true contradiction is ever actualized in physical reality.

**Why:** Non-Contradiction (NC) is constitutive. States violating NC exist in IIS as formal possibilities but cannot interface with Boolean actuality.

**Test:** This is continuously tested by all of physics. Any reproducible phenomenon violating NC would falsify LRT.

**Status:** No physical dialetheia observed in the history of science.

**Note:** This does not mean contradictions cannot be *described* or *modeled*. It means they cannot be *instantiated* in actuality.

### 7.2 Prediction: Identity Is Exact

**Statement:** Identical particles are truly identical - not merely indistinguishable to our instruments.

**Why:** Identity (I) is constitutive. Electrons are identical because they are excitations of the same mode of the distinguishability field.

**Test:** Quantum statistics depend on exact identity. Any deviation would show in Bose-Einstein / Fermi-Dirac statistics.

**Status:** Quantum statistics confirmed to extraordinary precision.

### 7.3 Prediction: Excluded Middle Holds in Actuality

**Statement:** Every actualized measurement has a definite outcome.

**Why:** Excluded Middle (EM) is constitutive of Boolean actuality.

**Test:** No "fuzzy" or "indefinite" measurement outcomes at the actualized level.

**Status:** All measurements yield definite outcomes. (Superposition exists in IIS, not actuality.)

### 7.4 Prediction: Entanglement Correlations Are Exact

**Statement:** Bell correlations are exactly as quantum mechanics predicts - no more, no less.

**Why:** 3FLL operate as global constraint. Correlations reflect constraint satisfaction across the entangled state.

**Test:** Precision Bell experiments.

**Status:** Confirmed in all loophole-free tests.

---

## 8. Testable Implications for Quantum Computing

### 8.1 Complexity Bounds

If S = ℏC, quantum computation has fundamental complexity limits:

**Prediction 8.1:** Circuit complexity is bounded by available action.

$$C_{circuit} \leq \frac{S_{available}}{\hbar}$$

**Test:** Compare circuit complexity metrics with energy/time resources.

### 8.2 Error Correction Limits

**Prediction 8.2:** Quantum error correction has fundamental thresholds related to distinguishability preservation.

**Why:** Error correction preserves quantum information (distinguishability in IIS). The threshold reflects minimum redundancy needed to maintain distinguishability against noise.

**Status:** Error correction thresholds are empirically studied. LRT provides interpretation.

### 8.3 Quantum Advantage

**Prediction 8.3:** Quantum speedup reflects the difference between IIS (exponential superposition) and Boolean actuality (polynomial readout).

**Why:** Quantum computers exploit IIS structure; classical computers operate in Boolean actuality. The interface (measurement) extracts classical answers from quantum computation.

**Status:** Quantum advantage demonstrated. LRT explains why.

---

## 9. What Would Falsify LRT?

A scientific theory must specify conditions for its own refutation. LRT is falsifiable:

### 9.1 Falsifiers: What Observations Would Refute LRT

| Observation | Why It Falsifies LRT | Current Status |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Real QM works** | Axiom 3(c) wrong | Ruled out (2021) |
| **Born rule violated** | Gleason/Axiom 5 wrong | Not observed |
| **Tsirelson bound exceeded** | Unique interface wrong | Not observed |
| **Physical dialetheia** | NC not constitutive | Not observed |
| **Local hidden variables work** | Bell wrong; 3FLL not global | Ruled out |
| **Contextuality violated** | Interface interpretation wrong | Not observed |
| **Macro superposition indefinitely stable** | No interface mechanism | Not observed |
| **Information exceeds Bekenstein bound** | S = ℏC wrong | Not observed |
| **Signaling via entanglement** | Global constraint interpretation wrong | Not observed |
| **Non-identical "identical" particles** | Identity not constitutive | Not observed |
| **Indefinite measurement outcomes** | EM not constitutive | Not observed |
| **Quaternionic QM works** | Axiom 3(c) wrong | Theoretically excluded |

### 9.2 The Status of Falsification

**Already tested (LRT passed):**
- Real vs. complex QM → Complex confirmed
- Bell inequalities → Violated as predicted
- Contextuality → Confirmed
- Born rule → Confirmed to 10⁻⁵
- Tsirelson bound → Confirmed

**Currently being tested:**
- Interface mechanism (Penrose vs. decoherence)
- Macro superposition limits
- Precision Born rule

**In principle testable:**
- Information bounds (Bekenstein)
- S = ℏC predictions

### 9.3 What LRT Does Not Predict (Hence Cannot Falsify)

LRT does not predict:
- Specific particle masses
- Coupling constants
- Number of generations
- Gauge group structure

These are fine-tuned parameters within the framework. Their values do not test LRT's core claims.

---

## 10. Comparison: LRT vs. Other Interpretations

### 10.1 Empirical Equivalence

All interpretations of quantum mechanics make the same predictions for standard experiments. This is by design - they interpret the same formalism.

### 10.2 Where LRT Differs

LRT makes commitments that other interpretations avoid:

| Commitment | LRT | Copenhagen | MWI | Bohmian | QBism |
|------------|-----|------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Complex numbers required | Yes (Axiom 3c) | Silent | Silent | Silent | Silent |
| Born rule unique | Yes (Gleason) | Postulate | Derived (contested) | Derived (equilibrium) | Normative |
| Single actuality | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes (per agent) |
| Realism about IIS | Yes | No | Yes (branches) | Yes (wave) | No |
| Explains contextuality | Yes (interface) | No | Partial | No | Partial |
| Global constraint | Yes (3FLL) | No | No | Yes (guidance) | No |

### 10.3 Novel Predictions Unique to LRT

1. **S = ℏC** - No other interpretation proposes this
2. **Structural fine-tuning** - LRT uniquely frames this as interface requirement
3. **3FLL as global constraint** - Novel interpretation of non-locality
4. **Interface mechanism** - LRT provides framework for interpreting results

## 12. Summary of Empirical Status

### 12.1 The Three Layers

| Layer | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Retrodictions** (phenomena explained) | 17+ | All confirmed |
| **Predictions** (testable claims) | 20+ | Ongoing tests |

### 12.3 Novel Content

LRT is not merely an interpretation. It:
1. Predicted complex QM (confirmed)
2. Proposes S = ℏC (testable)
3. Explains phenomena other interpretations assume
4. Specifies falsification conditions
5. Guides experimental program

---

## 13. Conclusion

Logic Realism Theory is empirically grounded. It:

**Retrodicts** 17+ quantum phenomena by providing unified explanation through the IIS/actuality interface framework.

**Predicts** testable claims including:
- Complex numbers required (confirmed 2021)
- Born rule exact (ongoing confirmation)
- Tsirelson bound exact (ongoing confirmation)  
- S = ℏC implications (testable)
- Interface mechanism (experiments 2025-2030)

**Specifies falsifiers** - conditions under which it would be refuted.

The theory is not immune to empirical test. It has passed every test conducted. Its novel predictions (especially S = ℏC) generate a research program extending decades into the future.

LRT demonstrates that quantum mechanics is not arbitrary but follows from logical structure plus stability requirements. The empirical success of quantum mechanics becomes, in this light, evidence for the constitutive role of classical logic in physical reality.

The laws of logic may indeed be the laws of physics - and the evidence supports this claim.
