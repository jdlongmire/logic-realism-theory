## Part I: Philosophical Foundations

### 1. Introduction: The Question
- Source: Paper 1 §1-2
- Content:
  - What is the status of logical laws?
  - Standard views: cognitive, linguistic, conventional
  - The realist alternative
  - Paper's contribution and structure
  - The central formula: A = L(I)

### 2. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws
- Source: Paper 1 §3-5
- Content:
  - Law of Identity (I): ∀x: x = x
  - Law of Non-Contradiction (NC): ¬(P ∧ ¬P)
  - Law of Excluded Middle (EM): P ∨ ¬P
  - Historical context (Aristotle to present)
  - Why "fundamental" - not reducible

### 3. The Central Argument: Inference to Best Explanation
- Source: Paper 1 §6-7
- Content:
  - Observation 1: No physical manifestation violates 3FLL
  - Observation 2: Human capacity sufficient to detect violations
  - Six candidate explanations evaluated:
    1. Coincidence
    2. Cognitive constraint
    3. Evolutionary adaptation
    4. Mathematical convenience
    5. Constitutive constraint (defended)
    6. Selection effect
  - Why "constitutive constraint" survives

### 4. The Infinite Information Space (IIS)
- Source: Paper 1 §10, Paper 2 §2
- Content:
  - IIS as co-primitive with 3FLL
  - Mutual constitution (not priority)
  - The magnetic poles analogy
  - IIS is not Boolean - contains richer structures
  - IIS contains all distinguishable states

### 5. Boolean Actuality
- Source: Paper 2 §2.2
- Content:
  - Actuality is where 3FLL are fully enforced
  - Every proposition has definite truth value
  - The asymmetry: 3FLL constitute IIS but only constrain actuality to be Boolean
  - The interface problem emerges

### 6. Objections and Responses
- Source: Paper 1 §11-16
- Content:
  - Unfalsifiability objection → Transcendental falsifiers
  - Category error objection → Structural features instantiated
  - Kantian alternative → LRT explains mathematical effectiveness, surprise, causal success
  - Epistemic gap objection → Transcendental, not inductive
  - Quantum mechanics objection → (deferred to Part II)
  - Dialetheism objection → No dialetheic physics exists
