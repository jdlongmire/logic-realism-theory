## Proposed Changes

### 1. Notation Updates

| Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 𝔍 (Information Space) | I∞ | Clearer, easier to type |
| 𝔏 (Logic) | L₃ | Emphasizes 3FLL |
| 𝔄 (Actualization) | A* | Standard notation |

### 2. New Sections to Incorporate

- [ ] **Primitive Criteria (§1.2)** - Explicit criteria for what counts as primitive
- [ ] **Purity Test** - Verification that primitives are truly primitive
- [ ] **Meta-Principles MP1-MP4** - Formal statement of guiding principles
- [ ] **Gödel Pre-Arithmetic Argument (§2.4)** - Logic precedes arithmetic

### 3. Conceptual Additions

- [ ] **Type 1/Type 2 Distinction** - Vehicle (structure) vs Content (what it carries)
- [ ] **Co-Fundamentality Analysis** - Logic and Information as co-fundamental
- [ ] **Necessity Operators** - □∃I, □∃L, □(P = L(I))
- [ ] **Fresh Circularity Verification** - Updated dependency analysis

### 4. Structure Improvements

- [ ] Cleaner derivation hierarchy diagram
- [ ] Comparison table (LRT vs Physicalism vs Tegmark)
- [ ] Explicit tier labeling throughout

## Files to Archive After Refactor

| File | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| `20251221-Claude-LRT-ground-up.md` | `archive/` (after extracting value) |
| Old versions of core paper | `archive/` |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract
- [ ] Extract key passages from new draft
- [ ] Extract key insights from ground-up conversation
- [ ] Catalog what's missing from current core paper

### Phase 2: Merge
- [ ] Apply notation updates across core paper
- [ ] Insert new sections at appropriate locations
- [ ] Integrate conceptual additions

### Phase 3: Verify
- [ ] Run circularity check on merged document
- [ ] Verify all derivations still flow correctly
- [ ] Check for internal consistency

### Phase 4: Clean
- [ ] Archive source files
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md references if needed
- [ ] Update README
