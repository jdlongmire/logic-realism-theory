## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) holds that the three fundamental laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - are not cognitive conventions or linguistic rules but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. This paper presents the unified framework: philosophical foundations establishing the ontological status of logical laws; the physical interpretation showing quantum mechanics as the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality; the mathematical formalization deriving Hilbert space structure via reconstruction theorems and the Born rule via Gleason's theorem; empirical grounding through 17+ retrodictions, 20+ testable predictions, and 12 explicit falsifiers; and consilience evidence from seven independent domains converging on identical deep structures. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from logic alone. We claim that quantum structure is uniquely selected by stability requirements - structural fine-tuning at the deepest level. One prediction (complex quantum mechanics required) has already been confirmed experimentally. The framework dissolves foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics, grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" program, and explains the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. It from bit; bit from fit.

## 1. Introduction: The Question

What is the status of the laws of logic?

This question, ancient in origin, admits several answers. The laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle - might be cognitive constraints: features of how minds necessarily operate. They might be linguistic conventions: rules we adopt to make communication possible. They might be useful fictions: approximations that work well enough for practical purposes. Or they might be something else entirely.

This paper defends a different view: **the three fundamental laws of logic are not merely rules of reasoning but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself.**

On this view - Logic Realism Theory (LRT) - the laws of logic do not describe how we think about reality. They describe what reality must be. A world that violated Non-Contradiction would not be a strange world we could visit; it would not be a world at all. The logical laws are not filters we impose on experience but the conditions under which experience - and existence - are possible.

The implications are substantial. If logic is constitutive of reality, then the structure of physics is not arbitrary. The "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" dissolves: mathematics and physics share a common root in logical structure. The puzzles of quantum mechanics - superposition, entanglement, the measurement problem - receive new interpretation. And a deep unity emerges across domains that appear disconnected: physics, information theory, thermodynamics, and computation converge on identical structures because they all study manifestations of the same underlying logical constitution.

### 1.1 The Central Formula

LRT can be expressed formally:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **A** (Actuality) is the realized physical world - what actually exists
- **I** (Infinite Information Space) is the totality of distinguishable states - everything that could be
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of 3FLL over IIS, together with the grounding structure that yields global parsimony (derived in Part III, not assumed)

Actuality equals logical filtering applied to the space of possibilities. This is the core thesis. Note that L is introduced here as 3FLL-enforcement; later sections show that enforcing groundedness forces a globally parsimonious Boolean structure.

### 1.2 What This Paper Does and Does Not Claim

We must be precise about claims from the outset.

**What LRT claims:**
- The three fundamental logical laws are ontological, not merely cognitive or linguistic
- Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between possibility (IIS) and actuality (Boolean structure)
- This explains otherwise mysterious features of quantum theory
- Multiple independent domains converge on structures LRT predicts

**What LRT does not claim:**
- That quantum mechanics is logically necessary (it is structurally fine-tuned)
- That all of physics can be derived from logic alone (physical constraints are also required)
- That consciousness or observation is explained (beyond functional role)
- That fine-tuning is explained (we situate it, not explain it away)

The distinction between derivation and fine-tuning is crucial. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that can interface between the rich possibilities of information space and the Boolean requirements of actuality. This is a selection claim, not a derivation claim.

### 1.3 Structure of the Paper

The argument proceeds in six parts:

**Part I (Sections 1-6)** establishes the philosophical foundations: what are the three laws, why think they are ontological, what objections arise, and how does IIS relate to 3FLL.

**Part II (Sections 7-15)** develops the physical interpretation: the interface problem, why quantum structure survives, the Born rule, and how foundational puzzles dissolve.

**Part III (Sections 16-22)** provides the mathematical framework: precise axioms, the derivation chain from 3FLL to Hilbert space to Born rule, and how existing interpretations fit.

**Part IV (Sections 23-30)** examines empirical grounding: retrodictions (what LRT explains), predictions (what LRT implies), and falsifiers (what would refute LRT).

**Part V (Sections 31-37)** presents the consilience argument: how independent domains converge on identical structures, supporting the thesis through unexpected agreement.

**Part VI (Sections 38-41)** synthesizes: honest accounting of what is derived versus assumed, comparison to other frameworks, and conclusions.

The reader may proceed linearly or jump to sections of particular interest. However, the argument is cumulative: later sections presuppose earlier ones.

## 2. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws

Since antiquity, three principles have been considered foundational to reasoning. Aristotle articulated them in Book Gamma of the *Metaphysics*, where he declares the law of non-contradiction "the firmest of all principles" (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1005b). These laws have remained central to logic ever since. We call them the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL).

### 2.1 Law of Identity

**Statement:** Everything is identical to itself.

$$\forall x: x = x$$

This appears trivially true - what else could a thing be but itself? Yet the law does substantial work. It asserts that things have determinate natures. A thing is what it is, not something else. Without identity, there would be no basis for predication: we could not say "A is F" if A were not determinately A.

Identity grounds reference. When we speak of an electron, we speak of *that* electron - the one identical to itself across time and context. Identity makes objects objects.

### 2.2 Law of Non-Contradiction

**Statement:** Nothing can both be and not be in the same respect at the same time.

$$\forall x, P: \neg(P(x) \land \neg P(x))$$

A thing cannot simultaneously have and lack the same property in the same respect. The electron cannot be both spin-up and spin-down *as an actualized measurement outcome*. The cat cannot be both alive and dead *as a determinate fact*.

Aristotle considered this the most certain of all principles - one that cannot coherently be denied, since any denial presupposes it (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1006a). Modern dialetheists challenge this claim, but as we shall see, their formal systems do not describe physical reality.

### 2.3 Law of Excluded Middle

**Statement:** For any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.

$$\forall x, P: P(x) \lor \neg P(x)$$

There is no middle ground between being and not-being. For actualized measurement outcomes, the electron is either here or not here. The proposition is either true or false. Excluded Middle rules out gaps in truth value.

This law is more contested than the others. Intuitionists reject it for mathematical domains where constructive proof is unavailable. But for actualized physical states - determinate facts about the world - Excluded Middle appears inviolable. (The distinction between indeterminacy in IIS and determinacy in actuality is central to our later treatment of quantum mechanics.)

### 2.4 Historical Context

Aristotle formulated these laws in the fourth century BCE, treating them as axioms of thought and being. The Scholastics elaborated them. Leibniz made them cornerstones of his philosophy. Frege and Russell built modern logic upon them.

In the twentieth century, challenges arose:

- **Intuitionist mathematics** rejected Excluded Middle for non-constructive domains (Brouwer, Heyting)
- **Paraconsistent logics** explored systems tolerating contradiction without explosion (Priest, 2006)
- **Quantum logic** questioned distributivity (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936)
- **Dialetheism** defended the existence of true contradictions (Priest, Beall, and Armour-Garb, 2004)
- **Logical pluralism** argued that multiple logical systems can be equally valid (Beall and Restall, 2006)

These developments show that *alternative formal systems* are possible. They do not show that *physical reality* violates the three laws. LRT distinguishes sharply between formal possibility (what can be symbolically represented) and ontological actuality (what can physically obtain). No paraconsistent logic has produced a physical theory; no dialetheist has exhibited a physical dialetheia.

### 2.5 Why "Fundamental"

We call these three laws "fundamental" for specific reasons:

**Not reducible:** On this framework, none of the three is derived from the others. Each does independent work. Remove any one and the logical structure collapses.

**Not conventional:** We did not choose these laws; we discovered them. Alternative conventions are conceivable but not actualizable.

**Constitutive:** They do not describe an independently existing reality; they constitute what it means for reality to be determinate at all. This is the metaphysical interpretation defended by Tahko (2009).

**Universal:** Every domain of inquiry presupposes them. Physics, biology, economics, history - all assume that their objects are self-identical, non-contradictory, and determinate.

### 2.6 The Scope Question

A crucial question: to what do the three laws apply?

**Cognitive interpretation:** The laws describe how minds must think. We cannot conceive of violations.

**Linguistic interpretation:** The laws are rules of language. Violating them produces nonsense, not falsehood.

**Ontological interpretation:** The laws describe reality itself. Violations are not merely inconceivable or nonsensical but impossible.

LRT defends the ontological interpretation. The laws are not about us - our psychology, our language, our conventions. They are about reality. A contradiction is not merely something we cannot think or say; it is something that cannot be.

This is the thesis we must now defend.

---

## 3. The Central Argument: Inference to Best Explanation

Before presenting the argument for Logic Realism, we must clarify the framework's structure. LRT rests on **two co-primitive foundations**:

1. **The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL)** - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle
2. **The Infinite Information Space (IIS)** - The totality of distinguishable states

These are not in a grounding relation where one explains the other. They are mutually constitutive: without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated noise - no state distinguishable from any other. Without IIS, 3FLL would have nothing to structure - laws without a domain. Together they form the minimal ontological base from which the distinction between possibility and actuality can be articulated.

This section establishes that 3FLL are ontologically constitutive (not merely cognitive or linguistic). Section 4 develops IIS as the co-primitive space that 3FLL structure. Section 5 explains how they jointly constitute Boolean actuality.

### 3.1 Observation 1: Universal Compliance

**No physical manifestation, observed or unobserved, violates the three laws of logic.**

This is not merely an empirical generalization from limited data. Every successful physical theory, every measurement, every causal interaction we have documented respects logical structure. No state of affairs has ever been recorded that instantiates a contradiction. The universality is striking.

Consider the history of physics. Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, the Standard Model - all presuppose and respect classical logic at the meta-level. When apparent paradoxes arise (Zeno's paradoxes, the twin paradox, Schrödinger's cat), resolution always preserves logical consistency. The paradox is in our understanding, not in reality.

Consider the attempts to interpret quantum mechanics as violating non-contradiction. Despite the strangeness of superposition, entanglement, and the measurement problem, quantum physics has consistently resisted interpretation as genuinely contradictory. What we find instead are complementarity frameworks, contextual properties, and probabilistic descriptions - all of which preserve logical consistency.

### 3.2 Observation 2: Detection Capacity

**Human representational capacity is sufficient to detect violations of the logical laws were they to occur.**

This observation is crucial for blocking a deflationary explanation. One might claim that we observe no violations simply because our cognitive apparatus is blind to them - that contradictions exist but we cannot recognize them.

Several considerations tell against this deflationary move:

**Syntactic representation.** We can form representations of contradictions. We can write sentences describing violations. We understand what it would mean for something to violate non-contradiction: "This apple is entirely green and entirely not-green at the same instant." Our representational apparatus is sensitive enough that a genuine violation would create detectable anomalies in our physical descriptions.

**Evolutionary pressure.** Contradictions are informational catastrophes. They eliminate inferential gradients. No agent could use contradictions to guide action because contradictions erase the difference between possible futures. If reality contained action-relevant contradictions, organisms that detected them would have survival advantages. Instead, evolution favored organisms that treat apparent contradictions as errors to be resolved - strong evidence that contradictions do not occur in survival-relevant reality.

**Scientific instrumentation.** Our detection capacity extends far beyond unaided cognition. We have instruments sensitive to phenomena our ancestors could not conceive - quantum states, gravitational waves, cosmic background radiation. If logical violations occurred at any scale we can probe, the systematic success of logically-structured physical theories would be inexplicable.

### 3.3 Candidate Explanations

Why do we observe no violations of logical laws in physical reality? Six candidate explanations present themselves:

**Candidate 1: Coincidence.** Perhaps it is mere happenstance that no violations have occurred in the portion of reality we have accessed.

*Assessment:* Implausible given the universality of the observation across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry. Coincidence becomes untenable as an explanation for exceptionless regularity.

**Candidate 2: Cognitive limitation.** Perhaps violations exist but our minds cannot detect them.

*Assessment:* Strongly disfavored by Observation 2. Our representational capacity is sufficient to form descriptions of violations; our instrumentation extends far beyond unaided cognition. If violations occurred at any scale we can probe, we would notice.

**Candidate 3: Constitutive constraint.** The laws of logic are structural features of reality itself. Nothing actualizes in violation of them because nothing can - logical structure is a precondition for any state of affairs to exist.

*Assessment:* This is the thesis we defend.

**Candidate 4: Analytic truth.** Perhaps "violations of logic" are not impossible states but pseudo-propositions with no sense - logical sentences have no factual content, so violation-talk is literally nonsense. Logic is not about reality's structure but about what counts as coherent language.

*Assessment:* This explanation cannot account for the predictive success of mathematical physics. At minimum, the success of mathematical physics shows that whatever logic captures is not *merely* a linguistic convention, since its structural constraints keep working far beyond the regimes in which original idealizations were introduced. Idealized models (frictionless planes, point particles, infinite populations) yield correct predictions despite ontological falsehood. The structure works independent of the assumptions.

**Candidate 5: Observer selection.** If observation requires logical structure, we would necessarily find ourselves in logically structured regions even if violations exist elsewhere.

*Assessment:* Insufficient. It requires that structured regions instantiate logical laws anyway - relocating rather than eliminating the question. And it does not explain the fine-grained logical alignment we observe across all domains, including those causally disconnected from us.

**Candidate 6: Description/described gap.** This differs from Candidate 4: here, logical sentences *do* have content, but logical structure applies only to descriptions, not to what is described. The world might be illogical even though our representations of it cannot be.

*Assessment:* Explanatorily inadequate. It cannot explain why descriptions continue to work across radically new physical domains, why mathematics predicts phenomena no one designed the mathematics for, or why the world is so comprehensively modelable. Moreover, even the distinction between description and described presupposes identity and non-contradiction.

### 3.4 Inference to the Best Explanation

Candidate 1 fails immediately; Candidate 2 is strongly disfavored. Candidates 4, 5, and 6 fail to explain the predictive success of mathematics, the uniformity of logical structure across disconnected regions, and the asymmetry between description and reality.

Only Candidate 3 remains.

By inference to the best explanation:

> **The laws of logic are constitutive constraints on physical reality.**

This is not to say that reality "obeys" logic as a student obeys a teacher. It is to say that reality *instantiates* logical structure - that determinate, non-contradictory, self-identical existence is what it means to be a physical state of affairs.

### 3.5 The Strength of the Argument

How strong is this inference? Not deductively certain. Inference to best explanation never achieves certainty. But the argument has significant force:

- The explanandum is universal and exceptionless
- Five of six candidates fail on independent grounds
- The remaining candidate is coherent, parsimonious, and explanatorily powerful
- No counterexamples exist despite extensive search

Compare to other inferences to best explanation we accept: the reality of electrons, the age of the universe, the existence of other minds. Logic Realism is at least as well supported as these.

This establishes the first primitive: 3FLL are constitutive. We now turn to the second primitive: the space that 3FLL structure.

---

## 4. The Infinite Information Space (IIS)

Having established that 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, we now develop the second primitive: the Infinite Information Space. This is not a second, independent ontology but the co-primitive partner to 3FLL - the domain that logical structure structures.

### 4.1 What IIS Is

**Definition:** The Infinite Information Space (IIS) is the totality of in-principle distinguishable states - every possible informational configuration constituted by 3FLL.

Several clarifications are essential:

**IIS is not a Platonic realm.** We do not posit abstract objects floating in a separate domain. IIS is not "somewhere else" - it is the structural space of what can be distinguished.

**IIS is not a set-theoretic construction.** We do not define IIS as a set of possible worlds or a collection of maximal consistent state-descriptions. Such constructions face cardinality paradoxes. IIS is better understood as a structural concept - what 3FLL make possible - than as a completed totality.

**IIS is not merely epistemic.** It does not represent what we do not know about an otherwise determinate reality. IIS contains genuinely indeterminate states - configurations that are distinguishable but not yet resolved into definite actuality.

**The positive characterization:** IIS is the **space of possibility** constituted by logical distinguishability. It is what can be, given that distinction is possible at all. Its "existence" is not the existence of a thing among things, but the existence of a structural condition - the condition under which there can be distinct states at all.

### 4.2 What "Information" Means

The term "information" invites misunderstanding. We must specify what we mean.

**Not Shannon information.** Shannon information is a statistical measure of surprise or entropy, defined relative to probability distributions over messages. IIS is not a communication channel and does not presuppose senders, receivers, or probabilities.

**Not semantic information.** Semantic information concerns meaning - what propositions are about. IIS is more primitive than meaning; it concerns what can be distinguished, not what distinctions mean.

**Not physical information (in the usual sense).** Physical information typically refers to degrees of freedom in a physical system - bits stored in memory, quantum states of particles. But IIS is not itself a physical system; it is the space from which physical systems are actualized.

**What we do mean: distinguishability structure.** "Information" in IIS refers to the structure of possible distinctions. A "state" in IIS is whatever can be distinguished from other states. The "information content" of a region of IIS is the complexity of distinctions it contains.

This usage aligns with a tradition running from Bateson - "information is a difference that makes a difference" (Bateson, 1972) - through Wheeler's "it from bit" (Wheeler, 1990). Information, in this sense, is more fundamental than matter or energy - it is the structure of distinction itself.

### 4.3 The Modal Status of IIS

What kind of thing is IIS? This question deserves careful treatment.

The risk of Pythagoreanism - the view that "structure is substance" or "mathematics is reality" - is real but navigable. We do not claim that IIS is made of mathematics. We claim that IIS is the structural space that 3FLL constitute, and that physical reality is what actualizes within it. The relationship is constitutive, not compositional.

This parallels standard moves in philosophy of modality. Just as possible worlds semantics does not require believing in concrete parallel universes (Lewis, 1986), IIS does not require believing in a separate realm of informational states. It is a framework for articulating what follows from the constitutive role of 3FLL.

### 4.4 Defending Co-Primitiveness

The claim that 3FLL and IIS are co-primitive may seem stipulative - a way of avoiding the hard question of which is more fundamental. We defend it as follows:

**The grounding regress.** If 3FLL ground IIS, what grounds 3FLL? If IIS grounds 3FLL, what grounds IIS? Any grounding chain must terminate somewhere. We propose that 3FLL and IIS terminate together - neither grounds the other because each requires the other to be what it is.

**Mutual constitution is coherent.** Consider the relationship between a metric and a space. The metric defines distances; the space is what has distances. Neither is prior - they are co-constitutive aspects of a single structure. Similarly, 3FLL and IIS are co-constitutive aspects of the structure of distinguishability.

**The magnetic poles analogy.** The north and south poles of a magnet are mutually dependent - you cannot have one without the other. But neither pole causes or temporally precedes the other. They are co-present aspects of a single magnetic structure.

Similarly, 3FLL and IIS do not "start" in sequence. They are co-present aspects of the structure of distinguishability itself. The question "which came first?" is malformed, just as "which came first, the north pole or the south pole?" is malformed.

**The alternative is worse.** If we take 3FLL alone as primitive, we face the question: 3FLL over what domain? If we take IIS alone as primitive, we face the question: what makes its states distinguishable? The co-primitiveness thesis answers both at once.

### 4.5 IIS Is Not Boolean

A crucial point: while 3FLL constitute distinguishability, they do not constrain IIS to be Boolean in structure.

**Boolean** refers to a system where every element has a definite binary value - true/false, 0/1, actual/not-actual.

**IIS contains more than Boolean structure.** It contains:
- Determinate states (fully specified configurations)
- Indeterminate states (distinguishable but not resolved to definite values)
- Superpositions (specific indeterminate states with interference structure)
- Classical mixtures (probabilistic combinations without interference)

This distinction is essential:
- **IIS:** Contains all distinguishable states, including indeterminate ones
- **Actuality:** The domain where 3FLL are fully enforced - Boolean, determinate, non-contradictory

The relationship between IIS and actuality is where quantum mechanics enters. This is developed in Part II.

### 4.6 The Library Analogy

Borges' "The Library of Babel" (1941) imagines a universe consisting of an enormous library containing every possible 410-page book - every true statement, every false statement, every string of gibberish. Most of it is noise. The meaningful books exist but are buried in infinity. Jonathan Basile's digital implementation (https://libraryofbabel.info/) allows exploration of this concept - every possible page of text is addressable and retrievable.

IIS is analogous. It contains every possible informational configuration. Most are not physical. Most do not correspond to anything stable. But everything distinguishable is there.

3FLL is what makes the library navigable. Without it, there are no distinct books - just undifferentiated text. 3FLL constitutes the possibility of one book being different from another.

Actuality is the book we are reading. Why this book? That question points beyond what this section establishes. But we can say what the book is: it is one path through IIS, the one that actualizes under the constraints of 3FLL and the selection of parsimony.

---

## 5. Boolean Actuality

The previous sections established two co-primitives: 3FLL and IIS. This section develops their relationship to actuality - the domain of determinate physical facts.

### 5.1 What Actuality Requires

Actuality is the domain where 3FLL are fully enforced. Any physical state of affairs - any event, measurement outcome, or determinate fact - must satisfy:

**Identity:** The state is what it is; it has determinate properties.

**Non-Contradiction:** The state does not simultaneously have and lack the same property.

**Excluded Middle:** For any well-defined property, the state either has it or does not.

This means actuality is **Boolean** - every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value. The actual world is a consistent, determinate configuration. There are no unresolved truth values in actuality, no superpositions of facts at the level of actual measurement outcomes. When something is actual, it is determinately so.

### 5.2 The Asymmetry Between IIS and Actuality

Here is the key insight: **3FLL constitute the structure of distinguishability in IIS, and they further constrain what can become actual by enforcing Boolean determinacy.**

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties. These are not contradictions - they are genuinely indeterminate configurations that 3FLL permit.

Consider the distinction:

| Domain | Structure | 3FLL Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **IIS** | Contains determinate, indeterminate, superposition, and mixture states | Constituted by 3FLL (distinguishability structure) |
| **Actuality** | Contains only determinate Boolean states | Constrained by 3FLL (full enforcement) |

The asymmetry is crucial. 3FLL do two different jobs:
1. They **constitute** what it means for states to be distinguishable at all (structuring IIS)
2. They **constrain** what can be actual (enforcing Boolean determinacy)

### 5.3 Why Actuality Must Be Boolean

Why cannot actuality contain indeterminate states? The answer lies in what actuality means.

**Actuality is what obtains.** To say that X is actual is to say that X is the case - determinately, not probabilistically, not potentially. Indeterminacy belongs in IIS. Once something is counted as actual, indeterminate truth status would either collapse into contradiction or violate Excluded Middle.

**Causal efficacy requires determinacy.** For causal relations among actual facts, states must be determinately what they are. If actual causes were literally neither one way nor another, causal structure would collapse. Physical laws operate on determinate states to produce determinate consequences.

**Observation confirms determinacy.** Every observation, every measurement, every detection yields a definite result. We never observe "half an electron" or "partially here." We often assign probabilities prior to measurement, but the recorded outcome is always a definite event.

### 5.4 The Interface Problem Emerges

This asymmetry creates a fundamental problem: **how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?**

IIS contains more than actuality can accommodate. Superpositions, indeterminate states, interference patterns - these exist as elements of IIS but cannot exist as fully actualized facts in Boolean A. Something must connect these domains.

This is the **interface problem**. It asks: what structure mediates between the non-Boolean possibilities of IIS and the Boolean requirements of actuality?

The answer, developed in Part II, is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is not arbitrary; it is the unique stable structure that can perform this mediation. But before developing this claim, we must address objections to the philosophical foundation.

### 5.5 The Central Formula Revisited

We can now state the thesis formula with greater precision:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **I** (IIS) is the space of in-principle distinguishable states, constituted by 3FLL
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of Boolean determinacy on distinguishable states, yielding actuality
- **A** (Actuality) is the Boolean domain where 3FLL are fully satisfied

The filtering operation L is not arbitrary selection. It is the requirement that whatever becomes actual must satisfy full Boolean structure. Part III will show that this requirement, combined with grounding principles, yields global parsimony as a theorem.

The interface between I and A - the structure that mediates non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality - is where physical law lives. Part II argues this interface is quantum mechanics.

---

## 6. Objections and Responses

The philosophical foundation developed in Sections 1-5 faces several serious objections. We address six. These objections target the philosophical foundation only; quantum-mechanical and empirical objections are treated in greater depth in Parts II and IV.

### 6.1 Objection 1: Unfalsifiability

**The objection:** When confronted with an apparent logical violation, the Logic Realist can always deflect: "You misdescribed the state of affairs," "The predicates are not genuinely contradictory," "That is equivocation." If any purported counterexample can be deflected, Logic Realism is unfalsifiable and therefore not a meaningful claim.

**Response:** The objection correctly identifies something important: Logic Realism is not an empirical hypothesis subject to Popperian falsification. It is a **framework claim** - a transcendental thesis about the conditions of possibility for any empirical investigation whatsoever.

This must be acknowledged honestly. LRT is more like "there is an external world" or "the future will resemble the past" than like "there are black holes at galactic centers." Framework claims are not tested by individual observations but by overall coherence, fruitfulness, and indispensability.

Nevertheless, Logic Realism faces what we call **transcendental falsifiers**:

1. A coherent, mathematically well-defined model of reality in which identity fails or contradictions function without inferential collapse or predictive incoherence. No such model exists.

2. A predictive framework that operates without identity, consistency, or determinate truth-values. No predictive discipline has ever functioned this way.

3. A demonstration that contradictions enhance prediction or that inconsistent information yields anything other than inferential noise.

Mathematically consistent inconsistent systems exist; empirically adequate ones do not. If logical structure cannot be dispensed with even in principle without collapsing predictive capacity, that is evidence for its constitutive status, not evidence of ad hoc immunization.

### 6.2 Objection 2: Category Error

**The objection:** Logic governs relations between propositions - statements that bear truth values. Physical reality consists of states of affairs - objects, properties, events. Applying logical laws to reality itself is a category mistake. Reality does not "obey" logic any more than an apple obeys modus ponens.

**Response:** The objection treats logical laws as syntactic rules for sentences rather than structural constraints on being. But this view cannot explain:

- Why the world is modelable at all
- Why mathematical structures predict physical phenomena
- Why all observed causal relations are logically structured
- Why discoveries surprise us (neutrinos, antimatter, dark energy)

A conceptual scheme cannot generate constraints it does not contain. When nature contradicts our expectations, something external is pushing back.

To say reality instantiates logical structure is not to ascribe rule-following to particles; it is to say particles can only exist as determinate entities rather than incoherent ones. The law of identity does not merely say "sentences must refer to themselves consistently." It says something more basic: whatever exists is what it is, rather than something else.

The objector cannot coherently deny that reality has determinate structure; they can only refuse to call that structure "logical." But calling the structure "logical" or "structural" makes no metaphysical difference; the point is that reality's structure has the same invariants logic formalizes.

### 6.3 Objection 3: The Kantian Alternative

**The objection:** Logic is not a feature of reality but a precondition for any possible experience. We cannot observe violations because observation itself presupposes logical structure. The absence of violations tells us about cognition, not mind-independent reality. The Kantian view is more parsimonious: it posits logical structure in cognition only, not in both cognition and reality.

**Response:** The Kantian position cannot explain several key features of our epistemic situation:

**The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.** If mathematics merely describes cognitive structure, then the predictive success of novel mathematical structures becomes unexplained. Einstein's field equations predicted gravitational waves decades before detection. Dirac's equation predicted antimatter. Maxwell's equations predicted radio waves. These structures were discovered, not imposed. Logic Realism explains the fit: mathematics works because reality instantiates the structural regularities that mathematics expresses (Wigner, 1960).

**The possibility of surprise.** If cognition structures experience, reality cannot push back in ways that surprise us. But science progresses precisely because nature contradicts expectations. Quantum mechanics was shocking. Non-Euclidean geometry was counterintuitive. Dark energy blindsided cosmology.

**The success of causal intervention.** We build lasers, alter quantum states, send spacecraft beyond the solar system. These are causal engagements, not mere perceptions. If the world were not structured according to determinate, non-contradictory relations, interventions would not yield repeatable outcomes. A spacecraft continues its trajectory whether anyone observes it; a nuclear reaction proceeds whether anyone measures it.

Kantianism can reinterpret these as phenomenal regularities, but doing so adds metaphysical machinery without explanatory gain.

**Parsimony reconsidered.** Kantianism's apparent simplicity conceals substantial machinery: an unknowable thing-in-itself, a strict phenomenal-noumenal divide, an unexplained harmony between thought and nature. Logic Realism requires no additional commitment beyond the world having determinate structure and our theories successfully tracking it.

### 6.4 Objection 4: The Epistemic Gap

**The objection:** Logic Realism claims that no physical manifestation - observed or unobserved - violates 3FLL. But our evidence consists entirely of observed phenomena. The inference from "no observed violations" to "no violations anywhere" is inductive and fallible. What about beyond the cosmological horizon, the first Planck moments, inside black holes?

**Response:** Logic Realism is not an inductive generalization from observed samples. It is a transcendental-ontological claim about what anything must be in order to qualify as a physical state of affairs.

Could logic fail beyond the cosmological horizon? The question is malformed. For a region of spacetime to exist, it must have determinate identity, non-contradictory metric structure, and persistent causal relations. If those fail, "region of spacetime" is no longer meaningful.

Logic Realism does not claim all possible universes must obey classical *laws*; only that any universe must instantiate identity, non-contradiction, and determinate structure to count as a universe at all. Without these, there are no states, no laws, no events, no persistence.

### 6.5 Objection 5: Quantum Mechanics

**The objection:** Quantum mechanics challenges classical logic: superposition ("the particle is here AND there"), wave-particle duality, non-distributive quantum logic, definite outcomes from indefinite states. If QM violates classical logic, Logic Realism fails at the most fundamental level.

**Response:** Quantum mechanics does not violate 3FLL. This point is central to the framework and receives detailed treatment in Part II. Here we offer the essential response.

**Superposition is not contradiction.** A superposition α|A⟩ + β|B⟩ is ONE state, not two contradictory states. The state vector is a perfectly definite mathematical object representing indeterminacy with respect to measurement outcomes, not the instantiation of contradictory properties.

**The crucial distinction: indeterminacy is not contradiction.** Indeterminacy belongs to IIS; contradiction would belong to actuality, where it never appears.
- Contradiction: The electron is at position x AND the electron is not at position x (simultaneously, in the same respect)
- Indeterminacy: The electron does not have a definite position (prior to measurement)

The first violates Non-Contradiction. The second does not. Quantum mechanics involves pervasive indeterminacy but zero contradiction.

**Contextuality is not contradiction.** The Kochen-Specker theorem shows that quantum properties cannot all have definite values independent of measurement context. Contextuality constrains classical value assignments, not logical consistency; it affects what values can coherently be defined, not the laws those values must satisfy. Logic Realism is not Classical Physics Realism.

**Measurement yields definite outcomes.** Every quantum measurement produces exactly one result. No measurement ever produces a contradictory result. This is not an interpretation-dependent claim: all viable interpretations agree on definite outcomes in the empirical record.

**QM preserves 3FLL.** The quantum formalism is built entirely on classical mathematics: Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and probability measures all assume 3FLL at the meta-logical level. The theory makes no sense without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle.

Part II argues that quantum mechanics is best understood as the unique stable interface between IIS (where indeterminate states live) and Boolean actuality (where 3FLL are fully enforced).

### 6.6 Objection 6: Dialetheism

**The objection:** Dialetheism holds that some contradictions are true - that there exist propositions P such that both P and ¬P obtain. Paraconsistent logics like LP (Logic of Paradox) show that contradictions can be manipulated without explosion. The Liar Paradox suggests accepting true contradiction is simpler than alternatives. Modern dialetheists (Priest, 2006; Beall, 2009) have developed sophisticated frameworks for this view.

**Response:** We take dialetheism seriously as the most developed challenge to Non-Contradiction.

**The Liar Paradox does not demonstrate true contradictions.** The Liar sentence generates paradox by applying "truth" self-referentially within a single semantic level. Tarski showed that truth for a language cannot be defined within that language without generating paradoxes. The Liar is a linguistic artifact, not a metaphysical revelation.

**Mathematical coherence does not entail metaphysical reality.** Paraconsistent logics demonstrate mathematical possibility, not ontological possibility. We also have non-well-founded set theories and inconsistent arithmetics; none entail that their exotic features are instantiated in reality. Even dialetheists typically locate true contradictions in semantic or set-theoretic constructions, not in empirical domains.

**The decisive consideration: no dialetheic physics.** Whatever the merits of dialetheism in philosophical logic, it has zero purchase in natural science. There is no paraconsistent physics, chemistry, cosmology, or biology. No scientific theory has ever employed dialetheist logic even in principle. Every successful physical theory presupposes classical logic at the meta-level.

This is not because scientists are unaware of paraconsistent logic. It is because contradictions are inferentially catastrophic in empirical contexts. A physics built on true contradictions would have no predictive power: if the electron is here AND not here, what do we expect to measure?

Nothing in physical reality exhibits dialetheic structure; therefore, nothing in physical ontology motivates rejecting Non-Contradiction as constitutive.

## Part II: Physical Interpretation

## 7. The Interface Problem

Part I established the philosophical foundations: 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, IIS is the co-primitive space of distinguishable states, and actuality is where 3FLL are fully enforced as Boolean determinacy. This section begins the physical interpretation by developing the central challenge this framework poses: how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?

### 7.1 The Problem Stated

Section 5 introduced the asymmetry between IIS and actuality:

| Domain | Structure | 3FLL Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **IIS** | Contains determinate, indeterminate, superposition, and mixture states | Constituted by 3FLL |
| **Actuality** | Contains only determinate Boolean states | Constrained by 3FLL |

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties - indeterminate configurations that 3FLL permit in the modal sense but that cannot become actual without Boolean enforcement.

Actuality, by contrast, must be fully determinate. When something becomes actual - when it manifests as a physical state of affairs - it must satisfy 3FLL completely. Every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value.

This creates the **interface problem**: what structure mediates between the non-Boolean possibilities of IIS and the Boolean requirements of actuality?

### 7.2 Interface Constraints

For any structure in IIS to interface with Boolean actuality, it must permit a map from its states to binary outcomes. This map must satisfy three constraints derived from 3FLL:

**Totality** (from Excluded Middle): The map must be defined for all states. Every state in the interface structure must be capable of yielding a definite outcome.

**Single-valuedness** (from Non-Contradiction): No state may yield mutually incompatible outcomes in the same measurement context. The map must produce no contradictory outputs.

**Distinguishability-preservation** (from Identity): If states are distinguishable in IIS, their possible actualization patterns must not collapse that distinction. Otherwise, the mapping to actuality would violate the constitutive role of Identity.

These constraints are minimal. They follow directly from 3FLL applied to the interface.

### 7.3 Multiple Structures Satisfy the Constraints

Here is the crucial observation: multiple mathematical structures satisfy these interface constraints.

**Classical probability** satisfies them. A probability distribution over outcomes, sampled to yield a definite result, produces Boolean actuality from a richer structure. The sampling is total (defined for all distributions), single-valued (each sample yields one outcome), and distinguishability-preserving (different distributions yield different outcome statistics, even though individual samples produce definite outcomes).

**Quantum mechanics** also satisfies them. A quantum state, measured in some basis, yields a definite outcome according to the Born rule. The measurement is total (defined for all states), single-valued (each measurement yields one outcome), and distinguishability-preserving (orthogonal states yield perfectly distinguishable outcomes; non-orthogonal states do not - exactly matching the IIS distinction between determinate and indeterminate structure).

**Other structures** - real Hilbert spaces, quaternionic quantum mechanics, generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), and even super-quantum models like PR-boxes - also satisfy the formal constraints.

### 7.4 The Selection Problem

If multiple structures satisfy the formal interface constraints, what selects among them?

This question is fundamental. Logic alone does not answer it. The interface constraints are necessary conditions for mediating between IIS and Boolean actuality, but they are not sufficient to uniquely determine the interface structure.

Three possible answers present themselves:

**Logical necessity:** Perhaps quantum mechanics is uniquely determined by some further logical or symmetry constraint we have not yet identified. This is the "derive QM from axioms alone" program pursued by Hardy, Chiribella-D'Ariano-Perinotti, and other reconstruction approaches.

**Brute contingency:** Perhaps quantum structure is simply the way our universe happens to be, with no deeper explanation. The selection is a brute fact.

**Stability selection:** Perhaps quantum structure is selected because it alone produces stable physics - atoms, chemistry, observers capable of inquiry. Other structures satisfy the formal constraints but produce no stable matter.

LRT defends the third answer. We do not claim that quantum mechanics is logically necessary. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique structure compatible with stable physical existence. This is a **selection claim**, not a derivation claim.

### 7.5 Why Selection Is Not Derivation

The distinction between selection and derivation is crucial for honest assessment of LRT's claims.

**Derivation** would mean: given only 3FLL and IIS, quantum mechanics follows by logical necessity. No empirical input is required. This is what LRT does *not* claim.

**Selection** means: given that actuality requires Boolean outcomes and that stable structures capable of causal persistence exist, quantum mechanics is the unique interface structure that produces both. The existence of stable structures is an empirical fact; the uniqueness of quantum structure as a stability condition is a theoretical claim subject to analysis.

This distinction matters because:

1. It preserves LRT's empirical vulnerability. If another structure were shown to produce stable physics, LRT's selection claim would be falsified. This makes the interface claim strictly empirical, not purely philosophical.

2. It correctly locates the fine-tuning. The fine-tuning is not in the logical laws themselves but in the selection of quantum structure from among the logically permissible options.

3. It explains why quantum mechanics has its specific form without claiming that form is logically inevitable.

### 7.6 Parsimony as Derived

One might ask: among the structures satisfying the interface constraints, why should actuality select the minimal one? Is parsimony an additional assumption?

No. Parsimony is derived from more fundamental commitments already internal to LRT.

The derivation proceeds as follows:

**Step 1: Constitution versus Constraint.** 3FLL do not merely *constrain* actuality (ruling out some configurations while permitting others). They *constitute* actuality - they generate the very structure within which determinate being is possible. This is LRT's core claim from Part I.

**Step 2: Constitutive Closure.** If principle P constitutes domain D, then D contains exactly the structure P generates - no more, no less. This follows the same pattern as mathematical axioms: the structure of the domain is nothing over and above what the axioms generate.

**Step 3: Truthmaker Requirement.** For any proposition in actuality to have a genuine Boolean value (not merely a stipulated one), something must ground that value. No proposition in actuality can have a free-floating truth value; every fact must be grounded. The grounding sources within LRT's minimal ontology are: logical necessity from 3FLL, logical entailment from grounded propositions, initial conditions, and propagation through derived dynamics.

**Step 4: Surplus Structure Excluded.** Any proposition not grounded by these sources cannot have a genuine Boolean value. But actuality requires genuine Boolean values. Therefore, surplus propositions are not just pruned - they are impossible within actuality.

**Conclusion:** Actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions - those whose Boolean values are determined by (3FLL + initial conditions) and their consequences. No surplus structure exists.

This is **Global Parsimony** - not as a methodological preference but as a structural consequence of what "actuality" means given LRT's constitutive architecture. The formal statement and proof appear in Part III.

### 7.7 The Path Forward

The interface problem now has a clear structure:

1. Actuality requires Boolean outcomes (from 3FLL enforcement)
2. Multiple structures can provide Boolean outcomes (classical, quantum, others)
3. Only quantum structure produces stable physics (selection claim)
4. Therefore, quantum structure is what we observe

The next sections develop each element of this argument:
- Section 8 analyzes the bit as the fundamental unit of distinguishability
- Section 9 examines why quantum structure specifically produces stability, showing how reconstruction theorems, stability arguments, and physical fine-tuning converge
- Section 10 addresses the Born rule
- Sections 11-15 develop implications and comparisons

## 8. Distinguishability and the Bit

The interface problem asks what structure mediates between IIS and Boolean actuality. Before examining candidate structures, we must analyze what distinguishability itself requires. This section establishes that the **bit** - the minimal unit of distinction - is constituted by 3FLL, and that this constitution has structural implications for any interface.

### 8.1 Distinguishability Is Constituted by 3FLL

Distinguishability is not a primitive fact discovered in the world. It is what 3FLL establish.

Consider what is required for state A to be distinguishable from state B:

- **Identity:** A = A and B = B. Each state must be determinately itself.
- **Non-identity:** A ≠ B. The states must differ. (Note: non-identity is not a separate logical law but is logically definable only because Identity and Non-Contradiction hold.)
- **Non-contradiction:** It is not the case that A = B and A ≠ B simultaneously.

Without these conditions, there is no basis for one state to be different from another. Distinguishability just *is* the application of 3FLL to a domain. This is why IIS is "constituted by" 3FLL rather than merely "constrained by" them - the very possibility of distinct states depends on logical structure.

Distinguishability exists at the level of IIS; actuality enforces only one branch of each distinction. This reinforces the asymmetry: IIS contains all distinguishable configurations, while actuality selects among them.

### 8.2 Distinguishability Is Pairwise

To distinguish is to compare. Distinguishability is inherently a relation between two things: how different is A from B?

This relational character means distinguishability naturally takes a **bilinear or quadratic mathematical form** - it involves pairs, not individuals. You do not ask "how distinguishable is A?" in isolation. You ask "how distinguishable is A from B?" The question is inherently comparative.

This observation is crucial for understanding quantum structure. The Born rule gives probabilities as $|\langle\psi|\phi\rangle|^2$ - the squared magnitude of an inner product between two states. This quadratic form is not accidental. It reflects the pairwise nature of distinguishability itself. The amplitude (inner product) captures the intrinsic relation between states; the squared magnitude yields the Boolean decision (probability of outcome).

Similarly, the inner product structure of Hilbert space - where states are characterized by their overlaps with other states - instantiates the relational character of distinction. States in quantum mechanics are not defined by intrinsic properties alone but by their relations to measurement bases and to each other.

### 8.3 The Bit as Fundamental Unit

The **bit** is the minimal unit of distinguishability - one binary distinction, a single yes/no question answered.

In LRT terms:

- **One bit** = the information required to distinguish between exactly two alternatives
- **Physical law reflects and instantiates the bit-structure** - it does not generate it. The logical structure of distinction is prior to the physical structures that instantiate it.
- **The grain of actuality is the bit** - you cannot have half a distinction. A proposition is either true or false; a state either obtains or does not. (In IIS, we can have partial or indeterminate structure; in actuality, distinctions are always Boolean.)

This connects directly to Wheeler's "it from bit" thesis: physical reality emerges from yes/no questions, from binary distinctions accumulated and related. LRT grounds this insight by showing that the yes/no question is the fundamental logical operation, and 3FLL constitute what makes such questions meaningful.

Wheeler wrote: "Every it - every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself - derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely... from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits" (Wheeler, 1990).

LRT explains *why* this is so: the bit is the atomic unit of 3FLL-constituted distinguishability. Physical reality must be Boolean at the level of actuality, and the bit is the minimal Boolean structure.

### 8.4 The Bit Scale

If the bit is the fundamental unit of distinguishability, and physical action is measured in units of ℏ (Planck's constant), then ℏ may be understood as the **conversion factor between logical and physical structure**:

$$S = \hbar \cdot C$$

Where S is action (physical) and C is complexity (informational, measured in bits).

This identification is conjectural. LRT does not require S = ℏC for its philosophical foundation, but this conjecture makes the link between logical and physical structure quantitatively precise. It receives support from independent results:

**The Bekenstein bound** states that the maximum entropy (information content) of a region is proportional to its surface area in Planck units:

$$S_{\text{max}} = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 G \hbar}$$

This is naturally interpreted as a maximum bit density of roughly one bit per Planck area. If ℏ is the bit-action conversion factor, this bound follows naturally: physical regions have finite action capacity, hence finite bit capacity.

**Black hole entropy** (the Bekenstein-Hawking formula) gives entropy proportional to horizon area in Planck units. In LRT terms: the horizon encodes the maximum distinguishability available to degrees of freedom associated with that region. A black hole of area A can contain at most A/(4ℓ²_P) bits of information.

**The holographic principle** generalizes this: the information content of any region is bounded by its boundary area, not its volume. This constraint appears as a physical limit but is equally interpretable as a limit on distinguishability-granularity if the bit is ontologically fundamental. Reality cannot support arbitrary information density because distinguishability itself has finite granularity.

### 8.5 Implications for Physical Structure

These connections suggest several conclusions (conditional on S = ℏC where noted):

1. **If S = ℏC, then one bit of complexity corresponds to approximately ℏ of action.** This sets the scale at which logical structure becomes physically manifest.

2. **The classical world appears continuous because specifying it exactly would require infinite bits at the level of description.** Continuity is an approximation that breaks down at scales where the bit-structure of distinguishability becomes directly relevant. This is a claim about description, not about ontology.

3. **The Planck scale marks the regime where the finite bit-structure of distinguishability becomes non-negligible.** At lengths of order ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³), the discrete structure can no longer be ignored relative to our measurements. This reflects the finite distinguishability capacity of physical structure.

4. **Quantum discreteness reflects bit-structure.** Energy levels, angular momentum quantization, and other discrete quantum features arise from Hilbert-space algebra and boundary conditions. This does not conflict with the bit interpretation; the algebra itself instantiates the finite-granularity of distinguishability.

5. **The quadratic structure of probability (Born rule) reflects pairwise distinguishability.** This connection is developed further in Section 10.

### 8.6 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Distinguishability is constituted by 3FLL, not discovered independently
- Distinguishability is inherently pairwise, giving it quadratic structure
- The bit is the minimal unit of this structure
- Physical constants (ℏ) may encode the conversion between logical and physical domains
- Several independent results (Bekenstein bound, holography) support this picture

This prepares the ground for Section 9, which asks: among the structures that can interface with Boolean actuality, why does quantum mechanics - with its specific Hilbert space, inner product, and Born rule structure - produce stable physics while others do not? The answer will show that quantum mechanics, and not classical probability or any other generalized probabilistic theory, is the unique stable structure compatible with this bit-based distinguishability architecture.
