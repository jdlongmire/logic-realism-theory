## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) holds that the three fundamental laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - are not cognitive conventions or linguistic rules but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. This paper presents the complete framework: philosophical foundations establishing the ontological status of logical laws; the physical interpretation showing quantum mechanics as the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality; the mathematical formalization deriving Hilbert space structure via reconstruction theorems and the Born rule via Gleason's theorem; empirical grounding through 17+ retrodictions, 20+ testable predictions, and 12 explicit falsifiers; and consilience evidence from seven independent domains converging on identical deep structures. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from logic alone. We claim that quantum structure is uniquely selected by stability requirements - structural fine-tuning at the deepest level. One prediction (complex quantum mechanics required) has already been confirmed experimentally. The framework dissolves foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics, grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" program, and explains the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. It from bit; bit from fit.

## 1. Introduction: The Question

What is the status of the laws of logic?

This question, ancient in origin, admits several answers. The laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle - might be cognitive constraints: features of how minds necessarily operate. They might be linguistic conventions: rules we adopt to make communication possible. They might be useful fictions: approximations that work well enough for practical purposes. Or they might be something else entirely.

This paper defends a different view: **the three fundamental laws of logic are not merely rules of reasoning but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself.**

On this view - Logic Realism Theory (LRT) - the laws of logic do not describe how we think about reality. They describe what reality must be. A world that violated Non-Contradiction would not be a strange world we could visit; it would not be a world at all. The logical laws are not filters we impose on experience but the conditions under which experience - and existence - are possible.

The implications are substantial. If logic is constitutive of reality, then the structure of physics is not arbitrary. The "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" dissolves: mathematics and physics share a common root in logical structure. The puzzles of quantum mechanics - superposition, entanglement, the measurement problem - receive new interpretation. And a deep unity emerges across domains that appear disconnected: physics, information theory, thermodynamics, and computation converge on identical structures because they all study manifestations of the same underlying logical constitution.

### 1.1 The Central Formula

LRT can be expressed formally:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **A** (Actuality) is the realized physical world - what actually exists
- **I** (Infinite Information Space) is the totality of distinguishable states - everything that could be
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the operation of the three fundamental laws plus parsimony - selecting from possibility to actuality

Actuality equals logical filtering applied to the space of possibilities. This is the core thesis.

### 1.2 What This Paper Does and Does Not Claim

We must be precise about claims from the outset.

**What LRT claims:**
- The three fundamental logical laws are ontological, not merely cognitive or linguistic
- Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between possibility (IIS) and actuality (Boolean structure)
- This explains otherwise mysterious features of quantum theory
- Multiple independent domains converge on structures LRT predicts

**What LRT does not claim:**
- That quantum mechanics is logically necessary (it is structurally fine-tuned)
- That all of physics can be derived from logic alone (physical constraints are also required)
- That consciousness or observation is explained (beyond functional role)
- That fine-tuning is explained (we situate it, not explain it away)

The distinction between derivation and fine-tuning is crucial. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that can interface between the rich possibilities of information space and the Boolean requirements of actuality. This is a selection claim, not a derivation claim.

### 1.3 Structure of the Paper

The argument proceeds in six parts:

**Part I (Sections 1-6)** establishes the philosophical foundations: what are the three laws, why think they are ontological, what objections arise, and how does IIS relate to 3FLL.

**Part II (Sections 7-15)** develops the physical interpretation: the interface problem, why quantum structure survives, the Born rule, and how foundational puzzles dissolve.

**Part III (Sections 16-22)** provides the mathematical framework: precise axioms, the derivation chain from 3FLL to Hilbert space to Born rule, and how existing interpretations fit.

**Part IV (Sections 23-30)** examines empirical grounding: retrodictions (what LRT explains), predictions (what LRT implies), and falsifiers (what would refute LRT).

**Part V (Sections 31-37)** presents the consilience argument: how independent domains converge on identical structures, supporting the thesis through unexpected agreement.

**Part VI (Sections 38-41)** synthesizes: honest accounting of what is derived versus assumed, comparison to other frameworks, and conclusions.

The reader may proceed linearly or jump to sections of particular interest. However, the argument is cumulative: later sections presuppose earlier ones.
