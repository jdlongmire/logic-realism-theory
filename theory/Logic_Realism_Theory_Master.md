## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) holds that the three fundamental laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - are not cognitive conventions or linguistic rules but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. This paper presents the unified framework: philosophical foundations establishing the ontological status of logical laws; the physical interpretation showing quantum mechanics as the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality; the mathematical formalization deriving Hilbert space structure via reconstruction theorems and the Born rule via Gleason's theorem; empirical grounding through 17+ retrodictions, 20+ testable predictions, and 12 explicit falsifiers; and consilience evidence from seven independent domains converging on identical deep structures. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from logic alone. We claim that quantum structure is uniquely selected by stability requirements - structural fine-tuning at the deepest level. One prediction (complex quantum mechanics required) has already been confirmed experimentally. The framework dissolves foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics, grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" program, and explains the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. It from bit; bit from fit.

## 1. Introduction: The Question

What is the status of the laws of logic?

This question, ancient in origin, admits several answers. The laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle - might be cognitive constraints: features of how minds necessarily operate. They might be linguistic conventions: rules we adopt to make communication possible. They might be useful fictions: approximations that work well enough for practical purposes. Or they might be something else entirely.

This paper defends a different view: **the three fundamental laws of logic are not merely rules of reasoning but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself.**

On this view - Logic Realism Theory (LRT) - the laws of logic do not describe how we think about reality. They describe what reality must be. A world that violated Non-Contradiction would not be a strange world we could visit; it would not be a world at all. The logical laws are not filters we impose on experience but the conditions under which experience - and existence - are possible.

The implications are substantial. If logic is constitutive of reality, then the structure of physics is not arbitrary. The "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" (Wigner, 1960) dissolves: mathematics and physics share a common root in logical structure. The puzzles of quantum mechanics - superposition, entanglement, the measurement problem - receive new interpretation. And a deep unity emerges across domains that appear disconnected: physics, information theory, thermodynamics, and computation converge on identical structures because they all study manifestations of the same underlying logical constitution.

### 1.1 The Central Formula

LRT can be expressed formally:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **A** (Actuality) is the realized physical world - what actually exists
- **I** (Infinite Information Space) is the totality of distinguishable states - everything that could be
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of 3FLL over IIS, together with the grounding structure that yields global parsimony (derived in Part III, not assumed)

Actuality equals logical filtering applied to the space of possibilities. This is the core thesis. Note that L is introduced here as 3FLL-enforcement; later sections show that enforcing groundedness forces a globally parsimonious Boolean structure.

### 1.2 What This Paper Does and Does Not Claim

We must be precise about claims from the outset.

**What LRT claims:**
- The three fundamental logical laws are ontological, not merely cognitive or linguistic
- Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between possibility (IIS) and actuality (Boolean structure)
- This explains otherwise mysterious features of quantum theory
- Multiple independent domains converge on structures LRT predicts

**What LRT does not claim:**
- That quantum mechanics is logically necessary (it is structurally fine-tuned)
- That all of physics can be derived from logic alone (physical constraints are also required)
- That consciousness or observation is explained (beyond functional role)
- That fine-tuning is explained (we situate it, not explain it away)

The distinction between derivation and fine-tuning is crucial. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that can interface between the rich possibilities of information space and the Boolean requirements of actuality. This is a selection claim, not a derivation claim.

### 1.3 Structure of the Paper

The argument proceeds in six parts:

**Part I (Sections 1-6)** establishes the philosophical foundations: what are the three laws, why think they are ontological, what objections arise, and how does IIS relate to 3FLL.

**Part II (Sections 7-15)** develops the physical interpretation: the interface problem, why quantum structure survives, the Born rule, and how foundational puzzles dissolve.

**Part III (Sections 16-22)** provides the mathematical framework: precise axioms, the derivation chain from 3FLL to Hilbert space to Born rule, and how existing interpretations fit.

**Part IV (Sections 23-30)** examines empirical grounding: retrodictions (what LRT explains), predictions (what LRT implies), and falsifiers (what would refute LRT).

**Part V (Sections 31-37)** presents the consilience argument: how independent domains converge on identical structures, supporting the thesis through unexpected agreement.

**Part VI (Sections 38-41)** synthesizes: honest accounting of what is derived versus assumed, comparison to other frameworks, and conclusions.

The reader may proceed linearly or jump to sections of particular interest. However, the argument is cumulative: later sections presuppose earlier ones.

## 2. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws

Since antiquity, three principles have been considered foundational to reasoning. Aristotle articulated them in Book Gamma of the *Metaphysics*, where he declares the law of non-contradiction "the firmest of all principles" (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1005b). These laws have remained central to logic ever since. We call them the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL).

### 2.1 Law of Identity

**Statement:** Everything is identical to itself.

$$\forall x: x = x$$

This appears trivially true - what else could a thing be but itself? Yet the law does substantial work. It asserts that things have determinate natures. A thing is what it is, not something else. Without identity, there would be no basis for predication: we could not say "A is F" if A were not determinately A.

Identity grounds reference. When we speak of an electron, we speak of *that* electron - the one identical to itself across time and context. Identity makes objects objects.

### 2.2 Law of Non-Contradiction

**Statement:** Nothing can both be and not be in the same respect at the same time.

$$\forall x, P: \neg(P(x) \land \neg P(x))$$

A thing cannot simultaneously have and lack the same property in the same respect. The electron cannot be both spin-up and spin-down *as an actualized measurement outcome*. The cat cannot be both alive and dead *as a determinate fact*.

Aristotle considered this the most certain of all principles - one that cannot coherently be denied, since any denial presupposes it (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1006a). Modern dialetheists challenge this claim, but as we shall see, their formal systems do not describe physical reality.

### 2.3 Law of Excluded Middle

**Statement:** For any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.

$$\forall x, P: P(x) \lor \neg P(x)$$

There is no middle ground between being and not-being. For actualized measurement outcomes, the electron is either here or not here. The proposition is either true or false. Excluded Middle rules out gaps in truth value.

This law is more contested than the others. Intuitionists reject it for mathematical domains where constructive proof is unavailable. But for actualized physical states - determinate facts about the world - Excluded Middle appears inviolable. (The distinction between indeterminacy in IIS and determinacy in actuality is central to our later treatment of quantum mechanics.)

### 2.4 Historical Context

Aristotle formulated these laws in the fourth century BCE, treating them as axioms of thought and being. The Scholastics elaborated them. Leibniz made them cornerstones of his philosophy. Frege and Russell built modern logic upon them.

In the twentieth century, challenges arose:

- **Intuitionist mathematics** rejected Excluded Middle for non-constructive domains (Brouwer, Heyting)
- **Paraconsistent logics** explored systems tolerating contradiction without explosion (Priest, 2006)
- **Quantum logic** questioned distributivity (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936)
- **Dialetheism** defended the existence of true contradictions (Priest, Beall, and Armour-Garb, 2004)
- **Logical pluralism** argued that multiple logical systems can be equally valid (Beall and Restall, 2006)

These developments show that *alternative formal systems* are possible. They do not show that *physical reality* violates the three laws. LRT distinguishes sharply between formal possibility (what can be symbolically represented) and ontological actuality (what can physically obtain). No paraconsistent logic has produced a physical theory; no dialetheist has exhibited a physical dialetheia.

### 2.5 Why "Fundamental"

We call these three laws "fundamental" for specific reasons:

**Not reducible:** On this framework, none of the three is derived from the others. Each does independent work. Remove any one and the logical structure collapses.

**Not conventional:** We did not choose these laws; we discovered them. Alternative conventions are conceivable but not actualizable.

**Constitutive:** They do not describe an independently existing reality; they constitute what it means for reality to be determinate at all. This is the metaphysical interpretation defended by Tahko (2009).

**Universal:** Every domain of inquiry presupposes them. Physics, biology, economics, history - all assume that their objects are self-identical, non-contradictory, and determinate.

### 2.6 The Scope Question

A crucial question: to what do the three laws apply?

**Cognitive interpretation:** The laws describe how minds must think. We cannot conceive of violations.

**Linguistic interpretation:** The laws are rules of language. Violating them produces nonsense, not falsehood.

**Ontological interpretation:** The laws describe reality itself. Violations are not merely inconceivable or nonsensical but impossible.

LRT defends the ontological interpretation. The laws are not about us - our psychology, our language, our conventions. They are about reality. A contradiction is not merely something we cannot think or say; it is something that cannot be.

This is the thesis we must now defend.

---

## 3. The Central Argument: Inference to Best Explanation

Before presenting the argument for Logic Realism, we must clarify the framework's structure. LRT rests on **two co-primitive foundations**:

1. **The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL)** - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle
2. **The Infinite Information Space (IIS)** - The totality of distinguishable states

These are not in a grounding relation where one explains the other. They are mutually constitutive: without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated noise - no state distinguishable from any other. Without IIS, 3FLL would have nothing to structure - laws without a domain. Together they form the minimal ontological base from which the distinction between possibility and actuality can be articulated.

This section establishes that 3FLL are ontologically constitutive (not merely cognitive or linguistic). Section 4 develops IIS as the co-primitive space that 3FLL structure. Section 5 explains how they jointly constitute Boolean actuality.

### 3.1 Observation 1: Universal Compliance

**No physical manifestation, observed or unobserved, violates the three laws of logic.**

This is not merely an empirical generalization from limited data. Every successful physical theory, every measurement, every causal interaction we have documented respects logical structure. No state of affairs has ever been recorded that instantiates a contradiction. The universality is striking.

Consider the history of physics. Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, the Standard Model - all presuppose and respect classical logic at the meta-level. When apparent paradoxes arise (Zeno's paradoxes, the twin paradox, Schrödinger's cat), resolution always preserves logical consistency. The paradox is in our understanding, not in reality.

Consider the attempts to interpret quantum mechanics as violating non-contradiction. Despite the strangeness of superposition, entanglement, and the measurement problem, quantum physics has consistently resisted interpretation as genuinely contradictory. What we find instead are complementarity frameworks, contextual properties, and probabilistic descriptions - all of which preserve logical consistency.

### 3.2 Observation 2: Detection Capacity

**Human representational capacity is sufficient to detect violations of the logical laws were they to occur.**

This observation is crucial for blocking a deflationary explanation. One might claim that we observe no violations simply because our cognitive apparatus is blind to them - that contradictions exist but we cannot recognize them.

Several considerations tell against this deflationary move:

**Syntactic representation.** We can form representations of contradictions. We can write sentences describing violations. We understand what it would mean for something to violate non-contradiction: "This apple is entirely green and entirely not-green at the same instant." Our representational apparatus is sensitive enough that a genuine violation would create detectable anomalies in our physical descriptions.

**Evolutionary pressure.** Contradictions are informational catastrophes. They eliminate inferential gradients. No agent could use contradictions to guide action because contradictions erase the difference between possible futures. If reality contained action-relevant contradictions, organisms that detected them would have survival advantages. Instead, evolution favored organisms that treat apparent contradictions as errors to be resolved - strong evidence that contradictions do not occur in survival-relevant reality.

**Scientific instrumentation.** Our detection capacity extends far beyond unaided cognition. We have instruments sensitive to phenomena our ancestors could not conceive - quantum states, gravitational waves, cosmic background radiation. If logical violations occurred at any scale we can probe, the systematic success of logically-structured physical theories would be inexplicable.

### 3.3 Candidate Explanations

Why do we observe no violations of logical laws in physical reality? Six candidate explanations present themselves:

**Candidate 1: Coincidence.** Perhaps it is mere happenstance that no violations have occurred in the portion of reality we have accessed.

*Assessment:* Implausible given the universality of the observation across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry. Coincidence becomes untenable as an explanation for exceptionless regularity.

**Candidate 2: Cognitive limitation.** Perhaps violations exist but our minds cannot detect them.

*Assessment:* Strongly disfavored by Observation 2. Our representational capacity is sufficient to form descriptions of violations; our instrumentation extends far beyond unaided cognition. If violations occurred at any scale we can probe, we would notice.

**Candidate 3: Constitutive constraint.** The laws of logic are structural features of reality itself. Nothing actualizes in violation of them because nothing can - logical structure is a precondition for any state of affairs to exist.

*Assessment:* This is the thesis we defend.

**Candidate 4: Analytic truth.** Perhaps "violations of logic" are not impossible states but pseudo-propositions with no sense - logical sentences have no factual content, so violation-talk is literally nonsense. Logic is not about reality's structure but about what counts as coherent language.

*Assessment:* This explanation cannot account for the predictive success of mathematical physics. At minimum, the success of mathematical physics shows that whatever logic captures is not *merely* a linguistic convention, since its structural constraints keep working far beyond the regimes in which original idealizations were introduced. Idealized models (frictionless planes, point particles, infinite populations) yield correct predictions despite ontological falsehood. The structure works independent of the assumptions.

**Candidate 5: Observer selection.** If observation requires logical structure, we would necessarily find ourselves in logically structured regions even if violations exist elsewhere.

*Assessment:* Insufficient. It requires that structured regions instantiate logical laws anyway - relocating rather than eliminating the question. And it does not explain the fine-grained logical alignment we observe across all domains, including those causally disconnected from us.

**Candidate 6: Description/described gap.** This differs from Candidate 4: here, logical sentences *do* have content, but logical structure applies only to descriptions, not to what is described. The world might be illogical even though our representations of it cannot be.

*Assessment:* Explanatorily inadequate. It cannot explain why descriptions continue to work across radically new physical domains, why mathematics predicts phenomena no one designed the mathematics for, or why the world is so comprehensively modelable. Moreover, even the distinction between description and described presupposes identity and non-contradiction.

### 3.4 Inference to the Best Explanation

Candidate 1 fails immediately; Candidate 2 is strongly disfavored. Candidates 4, 5, and 6 fail to explain the predictive success of mathematics, the uniformity of logical structure across disconnected regions, and the asymmetry between description and reality.

Only Candidate 3 remains.

By inference to the best explanation:

> **The laws of logic are constitutive constraints on physical reality.**

This is not to say that reality "obeys" logic as a student obeys a teacher. It is to say that reality *instantiates* logical structure - that determinate, non-contradictory, self-identical existence is what it means to be a physical state of affairs.

### 3.5 The Strength of the Argument

How strong is this inference? Not deductively certain. Inference to best explanation never achieves certainty. But the argument has significant force:

- The explanandum is universal and exceptionless
- Five of six candidates fail on independent grounds
- The remaining candidate is coherent, parsimonious, and explanatorily powerful
- No counterexamples exist despite extensive search

Compare to other inferences to best explanation we accept: the reality of electrons, the age of the universe, the existence of other minds. Logic Realism is at least as well supported as these.

This establishes the first primitive: 3FLL are constitutive. We now turn to the second primitive: the space that 3FLL structure.

---

## 4. The Infinite Information Space (IIS)

Having established that 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, we now develop the second primitive: the Infinite Information Space. This is not a second, independent ontology but the co-primitive partner to 3FLL - the domain that logical structure structures.

### 4.1 What IIS Is

**Definition:** The Infinite Information Space (IIS) is the totality of in-principle distinguishable states - every possible informational configuration constituted by 3FLL.

Several clarifications are essential:

**IIS is not a Platonic realm.** We do not posit abstract objects floating in a separate domain. IIS is not "somewhere else" - it is the structural space of what can be distinguished.

**IIS is not a set-theoretic construction.** We do not define IIS as a set of possible worlds or a collection of maximal consistent state-descriptions. Such constructions face cardinality paradoxes. IIS is better understood as a structural concept - what 3FLL make possible - than as a completed totality.

**IIS is not merely epistemic.** It does not represent what we do not know about an otherwise determinate reality. IIS contains genuinely indeterminate states - configurations that are distinguishable but not yet resolved into definite actuality.

**The positive characterization:** IIS is the **space of possibility** constituted by logical distinguishability. It is what can be, given that distinction is possible at all. Its "existence" is not the existence of a thing among things, but the existence of a structural condition - the condition under which there can be distinct states at all.

### 4.2 What "Information" Means

The term "information" invites misunderstanding. We must specify what we mean.

**Not Shannon information.** Shannon information is a statistical measure of surprise or entropy, defined relative to probability distributions over messages. IIS is not a communication channel and does not presuppose senders, receivers, or probabilities.

**Not semantic information.** Semantic information concerns meaning - what propositions are about. IIS is more primitive than meaning; it concerns what can be distinguished, not what distinctions mean.

**Not physical information (in the usual sense).** Physical information typically refers to degrees of freedom in a physical system - bits stored in memory, quantum states of particles. But IIS is not itself a physical system; it is the space from which physical systems are actualized.

**What we do mean: distinguishability structure.** "Information" in IIS refers to the structure of possible distinctions. A "state" in IIS is whatever can be distinguished from other states. The "information content" of a region of IIS is the complexity of distinctions it contains.

This usage aligns with a tradition running from Bateson - "information is a difference that makes a difference" (Bateson, 1972) - through Wheeler's "it from bit" (Wheeler, 1990) and Shannon's foundational work on information theory (Shannon, 1948). Information, in this sense, is more fundamental than matter or energy - it is the structure of distinction itself.

### 4.3 The Modal Status of IIS

What kind of thing is IIS? This question deserves careful treatment.

The risk of Pythagoreanism - the view that "structure is substance" or "mathematics is reality" - is real but navigable. We do not claim that IIS is made of mathematics. We claim that IIS is the structural space that 3FLL constitute, and that physical reality is what actualizes within it. The relationship is constitutive, not compositional.

This parallels standard moves in philosophy of modality. Just as possible worlds semantics does not require believing in concrete parallel universes (Lewis, 1986), IIS does not require believing in a separate realm of informational states. It is a framework for articulating what follows from the constitutive role of 3FLL.

### 4.4 Defending Co-Primitiveness

The claim that 3FLL and IIS are co-primitive may seem stipulative - a way of avoiding the hard question of which is more fundamental. We defend it as follows:

**The grounding regress.** If 3FLL ground IIS, what grounds 3FLL? If IIS grounds 3FLL, what grounds IIS? Any grounding chain must terminate somewhere. We propose that 3FLL and IIS terminate together - neither grounds the other because each requires the other to be what it is.

**Mutual constitution is coherent.** Consider the relationship between a metric and a space. The metric defines distances; the space is what has distances. Neither is prior - they are co-constitutive aspects of a single structure. Similarly, 3FLL and IIS are co-constitutive aspects of the structure of distinguishability.

**The magnetic poles analogy.** The north and south poles of a magnet are mutually dependent - you cannot have one without the other. But neither pole causes or temporally precedes the other. They are co-present aspects of a single magnetic structure.

Similarly, 3FLL and IIS do not "start" in sequence. They are co-present aspects of the structure of distinguishability itself. The question "which came first?" is malformed, just as "which came first, the north pole or the south pole?" is malformed.

**The alternative is worse.** If we take 3FLL alone as primitive, we face the question: 3FLL over what domain? If we take IIS alone as primitive, we face the question: what makes its states distinguishable? The co-primitiveness thesis answers both at once.

### 4.5 IIS Is Not Boolean

A crucial point: while 3FLL constitute distinguishability, they do not constrain IIS to be Boolean in structure.

**Boolean** refers to a system where every element has a definite binary value - true/false, 0/1, actual/not-actual.

**IIS contains more than Boolean structure.** It contains:
- Determinate states (fully specified configurations)
- Indeterminate states (distinguishable but not resolved to definite values)
- Superpositions (specific indeterminate states with interference structure)
- Classical mixtures (probabilistic combinations without interference)

This distinction is essential:
- **IIS:** Contains all distinguishable states, including indeterminate ones
- **Actuality:** The domain where 3FLL are fully enforced - Boolean, determinate, non-contradictory

The relationship between IIS and actuality is where quantum mechanics enters. This is developed in Part II.

### 4.6 The Library Analogy

Borges' "The Library of Babel" (1941) imagines a universe consisting of an enormous library containing every possible 410-page book - every true statement, every false statement, every string of gibberish. Most of it is noise. The meaningful books exist but are buried in infinity. Jonathan Basile's digital implementation (https://libraryofbabel.info/) allows exploration of this concept - every possible page of text is addressable and retrievable.

IIS is analogous. It contains every possible informational configuration. Most are not physical. Most do not correspond to anything stable. But everything distinguishable is there.

3FLL is what makes the library navigable. Without it, there are no distinct books - just undifferentiated text. 3FLL constitutes the possibility of one book being different from another.

Actuality is the book we are reading. Why this book? That question points beyond what this section establishes. But we can say what the book is: it is one path through IIS, the one that actualizes under the constraints of 3FLL and the selection of parsimony.

---

## 5. Boolean Actuality

The previous sections established two co-primitives: 3FLL and IIS. This section develops their relationship to actuality - the domain of determinate physical facts.

### 5.1 What Actuality Requires

Actuality is the domain where 3FLL are fully enforced. Any physical state of affairs - any event, measurement outcome, or determinate fact - must satisfy:

**Identity:** The state is what it is; it has determinate properties.

**Non-Contradiction:** The state does not simultaneously have and lack the same property.

**Excluded Middle:** For any well-defined property, the state either has it or does not.

This means actuality is **Boolean** - every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value. The actual world is a consistent, determinate configuration. There are no unresolved truth values in actuality, no superpositions of facts at the level of actual measurement outcomes. When something is actual, it is determinately so.

### 5.2 The Asymmetry Between IIS and Actuality

Here is the key insight: **3FLL constitute the structure of distinguishability in IIS, and they further constrain what can become actual by enforcing Boolean determinacy.**

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties. These are not contradictions - they are genuinely indeterminate configurations that 3FLL permit.

Consider the distinction:

| Domain | Structure | 3FLL Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **IIS** | Contains determinate, indeterminate, superposition, and mixture states | Constituted by 3FLL (distinguishability structure) |
| **Actuality** | Contains only determinate Boolean states | Constrained by 3FLL (full enforcement) |

The asymmetry is crucial. 3FLL do two different jobs:
1. They **constitute** what it means for states to be distinguishable at all (structuring IIS)
2. They **constrain** what can be actual (enforcing Boolean determinacy)

### 5.3 Why Actuality Must Be Boolean

Why cannot actuality contain indeterminate states? The answer lies in what actuality means.

**Actuality is what obtains.** To say that X is actual is to say that X is the case - determinately, not probabilistically, not potentially. Indeterminacy belongs in IIS. Once something is counted as actual, indeterminate truth status would either collapse into contradiction or violate Excluded Middle.

**Causal efficacy requires determinacy.** For causal relations among actual facts, states must be determinately what they are. If actual causes were literally neither one way nor another, causal structure would collapse. Physical laws operate on determinate states to produce determinate consequences.

**Observation confirms determinacy.** Every observation, every measurement, every detection yields a definite result. We never observe "half an electron" or "partially here." We often assign probabilities prior to measurement, but the recorded outcome is always a definite event.

### 5.4 The Interface Problem Emerges

This asymmetry creates a fundamental problem: **how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?**

IIS contains more than actuality can accommodate. Superpositions, indeterminate states, interference patterns - these exist as elements of IIS but cannot exist as fully actualized facts in Boolean A. Something must connect these domains.

This is the **interface problem**. It asks: what structure mediates between the non-Boolean possibilities of IIS and the Boolean requirements of actuality?

The answer, developed in Part II, is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is not arbitrary; it is the unique stable structure that can perform this mediation. But before developing this claim, we must address objections to the philosophical foundation.

### 5.5 The Central Formula Revisited

We can now state the thesis formula with greater precision:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **I** (IIS) is the space of in-principle distinguishable states, constituted by 3FLL
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of Boolean determinacy on distinguishable states, yielding actuality
- **A** (Actuality) is the Boolean domain where 3FLL are fully satisfied

The filtering operation L is not arbitrary selection. It is the requirement that whatever becomes actual must satisfy full Boolean structure. Part III will show that this requirement, combined with grounding principles, yields global parsimony as a theorem.

The interface between I and A - the structure that mediates non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality - is where physical law lives. Part II argues this interface is quantum mechanics.

---

## 6. Objections and Responses

The philosophical foundation developed in Sections 1-5 faces several serious objections. We address six. These objections target the philosophical foundation only; quantum-mechanical and empirical objections are treated in greater depth in Parts II and IV.

### 6.1 Objection 1: Unfalsifiability

**The objection:** When confronted with an apparent logical violation, the Logic Realist can always deflect: "You misdescribed the state of affairs," "The predicates are not genuinely contradictory," "That is equivocation." If any purported counterexample can be deflected, Logic Realism is unfalsifiable and therefore not a meaningful claim.

**Response:** The objection correctly identifies something important: Logic Realism is not an empirical hypothesis subject to Popperian falsification. It is a **framework claim** - a transcendental thesis about the conditions of possibility for any empirical investigation whatsoever.

This must be acknowledged honestly. LRT is more like "there is an external world" or "the future will resemble the past" than like "there are black holes at galactic centers." Framework claims are not tested by individual observations but by overall coherence, fruitfulness, and indispensability.

Nevertheless, Logic Realism faces what we call **transcendental falsifiers**:

1. A coherent, mathematically well-defined model of reality in which identity fails or contradictions function without inferential collapse or predictive incoherence. No such model exists.

2. A predictive framework that operates without identity, consistency, or determinate truth-values. No predictive discipline has ever functioned this way.

3. A demonstration that contradictions enhance prediction or that inconsistent information yields anything other than inferential noise.

Mathematically consistent inconsistent systems exist; empirically adequate ones do not. If logical structure cannot be dispensed with even in principle without collapsing predictive capacity, that is evidence for its constitutive status, not evidence of ad hoc immunization.

### 6.2 Objection 2: Category Error

**The objection:** Logic governs relations between propositions - statements that bear truth values. Physical reality consists of states of affairs - objects, properties, events. Applying logical laws to reality itself is a category mistake. Reality does not "obey" logic any more than an apple obeys modus ponens.

**Response:** The objection treats logical laws as syntactic rules for sentences rather than structural constraints on being. But this view cannot explain:

- Why the world is modelable at all
- Why mathematical structures predict physical phenomena
- Why all observed causal relations are logically structured
- Why discoveries surprise us (neutrinos, antimatter, dark energy)

A conceptual scheme cannot generate constraints it does not contain. When nature contradicts our expectations, something external is pushing back.

To say reality instantiates logical structure is not to ascribe rule-following to particles; it is to say particles can only exist as determinate entities rather than incoherent ones. The law of identity does not merely say "sentences must refer to themselves consistently." It says something more basic: whatever exists is what it is, rather than something else.

The objector cannot coherently deny that reality has determinate structure; they can only refuse to call that structure "logical." But calling the structure "logical" or "structural" makes no metaphysical difference; the point is that reality's structure has the same invariants logic formalizes.

### 6.3 Objection 3: The Kantian Alternative

**The objection:** Logic is not a feature of reality but a precondition for any possible experience. We cannot observe violations because observation itself presupposes logical structure. The absence of violations tells us about cognition, not mind-independent reality. The Kantian view is more parsimonious: it posits logical structure in cognition only, not in both cognition and reality.

**Response:** The Kantian position cannot explain several key features of our epistemic situation:

**The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.** If mathematics merely describes cognitive structure, then the predictive success of novel mathematical structures becomes unexplained. Einstein's field equations predicted gravitational waves decades before detection. Dirac's equation predicted antimatter. Maxwell's equations predicted radio waves. These structures were discovered, not imposed. Logic Realism explains the fit: mathematics works because reality instantiates the structural regularities that mathematics expresses (Wigner, 1960).

**The possibility of surprise.** If cognition structures experience, reality cannot push back in ways that surprise us. But science progresses precisely because nature contradicts expectations. Quantum mechanics was shocking. Non-Euclidean geometry was counterintuitive. Dark energy blindsided cosmology.

**The success of causal intervention.** We build lasers, alter quantum states, send spacecraft beyond the solar system. These are causal engagements, not mere perceptions. If the world were not structured according to determinate, non-contradictory relations, interventions would not yield repeatable outcomes. A spacecraft continues its trajectory whether anyone observes it; a nuclear reaction proceeds whether anyone measures it.

Kantianism can reinterpret these as phenomenal regularities, but doing so adds metaphysical machinery without explanatory gain.

**Parsimony reconsidered.** Kantianism's apparent simplicity conceals substantial machinery: an unknowable thing-in-itself, a strict phenomenal-noumenal divide, an unexplained harmony between thought and nature. Logic Realism requires no additional commitment beyond the world having determinate structure and our theories successfully tracking it.

### 6.4 Objection 4: The Epistemic Gap

**The objection:** Logic Realism claims that no physical manifestation - observed or unobserved - violates 3FLL. But our evidence consists entirely of observed phenomena. The inference from "no observed violations" to "no violations anywhere" is inductive and fallible. What about beyond the cosmological horizon, the first Planck moments, inside black holes?

**Response:** Logic Realism is not an inductive generalization from observed samples. It is a transcendental-ontological claim about what anything must be in order to qualify as a physical state of affairs.

Could logic fail beyond the cosmological horizon? The question is malformed. For a region of spacetime to exist, it must have determinate identity, non-contradictory metric structure, and persistent causal relations. If those fail, "region of spacetime" is no longer meaningful.

Logic Realism does not claim all possible universes must obey classical *laws*; only that any universe must instantiate identity, non-contradiction, and determinate structure to count as a universe at all. Without these, there are no states, no laws, no events, no persistence.

### 6.5 Objection 5: Quantum Mechanics

**The objection:** Quantum mechanics challenges classical logic: superposition ("the particle is here AND there"), wave-particle duality, non-distributive quantum logic, definite outcomes from indefinite states. If QM violates classical logic, Logic Realism fails at the most fundamental level.

**Response:** Quantum mechanics does not violate 3FLL. This point is central to the framework and receives detailed treatment in Part II. Here we offer the essential response.

**Superposition is not contradiction.** A superposition α|A⟩ + β|B⟩ is ONE state, not two contradictory states. The state vector is a perfectly definite mathematical object representing indeterminacy with respect to measurement outcomes, not the instantiation of contradictory properties.

**The crucial distinction: indeterminacy is not contradiction.** Indeterminacy belongs to IIS; contradiction would belong to actuality, where it never appears.
- Contradiction: The electron is at position x AND the electron is not at position x (simultaneously, in the same respect)
- Indeterminacy: The electron does not have a definite position (prior to measurement)

The first violates Non-Contradiction. The second does not. Quantum mechanics involves pervasive indeterminacy but zero contradiction.

**Contextuality is not contradiction.** The Kochen-Specker theorem shows that quantum properties cannot all have definite values independent of measurement context. Contextuality constrains classical value assignments, not logical consistency; it affects what values can coherently be defined, not the laws those values must satisfy. Logic Realism is not Classical Physics Realism.

**Measurement yields definite outcomes.** Every quantum measurement produces exactly one result. No measurement ever produces a contradictory result. This is not an interpretation-dependent claim: all viable interpretations agree on definite outcomes in the empirical record.

**QM preserves 3FLL.** The quantum formalism is built entirely on classical mathematics: Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and probability measures all assume 3FLL at the meta-logical level. The theory makes no sense without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle.

Part II argues that quantum mechanics is best understood as the unique stable interface between IIS (where indeterminate states live) and Boolean actuality (where 3FLL are fully enforced).

### 6.6 Objection 6: Dialetheism

**The objection:** Dialetheism holds that some contradictions are true - that there exist propositions P such that both P and ¬P obtain. Paraconsistent logics like LP (Logic of Paradox) show that contradictions can be manipulated without explosion. The Liar Paradox suggests accepting true contradiction is simpler than alternatives. Modern dialetheists (Priest, 2006; Beall, 2009) have developed sophisticated frameworks for this view.

**Response:** We take dialetheism seriously as the most developed challenge to Non-Contradiction.

**The Liar Paradox does not demonstrate true contradictions.** The Liar sentence generates paradox by applying "truth" self-referentially within a single semantic level. Tarski showed that truth for a language cannot be defined within that language without generating paradoxes. The Liar is a linguistic artifact, not a metaphysical revelation.

**Mathematical coherence does not entail metaphysical reality.** Paraconsistent logics demonstrate mathematical possibility, not ontological possibility. We also have non-well-founded set theories and inconsistent arithmetics; none entail that their exotic features are instantiated in reality. Even dialetheists typically locate true contradictions in semantic or set-theoretic constructions, not in empirical domains.

**The decisive consideration: no dialetheic physics.** Whatever the merits of dialetheism in philosophical logic, it has zero purchase in natural science. There is no paraconsistent physics, chemistry, cosmology, or biology. No scientific theory has ever employed dialetheist logic even in principle. Every successful physical theory presupposes classical logic at the meta-level.

This is not because scientists are unaware of paraconsistent logic. It is because contradictions are inferentially catastrophic in empirical contexts. A physics built on true contradictions would have no predictive power: if the electron is here AND not here, what do we expect to measure?

Nothing in physical reality exhibits dialetheic structure; therefore, nothing in physical ontology motivates rejecting Non-Contradiction as constitutive.

## Part II: Physical Interpretation

---

## 7. The Interface Problem

Part I established the philosophical foundations: 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, IIS is the co-primitive space of distinguishable states, and actuality is where 3FLL are fully enforced as Boolean determinacy. This section begins the physical interpretation by developing the central challenge this framework poses: how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?

### 7.1 The Problem Stated

Section 5 introduced the asymmetry between IIS and actuality:

| Domain | Structure | 3FLL Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **IIS** | Contains determinate, indeterminate, superposition, and mixture states | Constituted by 3FLL |
| **Actuality** | Contains only determinate Boolean states | Constrained by 3FLL |

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties - indeterminate configurations that 3FLL permit in the modal sense but that cannot become actual without Boolean enforcement.

Actuality, by contrast, must be fully determinate. When something becomes actual - when it manifests as a physical state of affairs - it must satisfy 3FLL completely. Every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value.

This creates the **interface problem**: what structure mediates between the non-Boolean possibilities of IIS and the Boolean requirements of actuality?

### 7.2 Interface Constraints

For any structure in IIS to interface with Boolean actuality, it must permit a map from its states to binary outcomes. This map must satisfy three constraints derived from 3FLL:

**Totality** (from Excluded Middle): The map must be defined for all states. Every state in the interface structure must be capable of yielding a definite outcome.

**Single-valuedness** (from Non-Contradiction): No state may yield mutually incompatible outcomes in the same measurement context. The map must produce no contradictory outputs.

**Distinguishability-preservation** (from Identity): If states are distinguishable in IIS, their possible actualization patterns must not collapse that distinction. Otherwise, the mapping to actuality would violate the constitutive role of Identity.

These constraints are minimal. They follow directly from 3FLL applied to the interface.

### 7.3 Multiple Structures Satisfy the Constraints

Here is the crucial observation: multiple mathematical structures satisfy these interface constraints.

**Classical probability** satisfies them. A probability distribution over outcomes, sampled to yield a definite result, produces Boolean actuality from a richer structure. The sampling is total (defined for all distributions), single-valued (each sample yields one outcome), and distinguishability-preserving (different distributions yield different outcome statistics, even though individual samples produce definite outcomes).

**Quantum mechanics** also satisfies them. A quantum state, measured in some basis, yields a definite outcome according to the Born rule. The measurement is total (defined for all states), single-valued (each measurement yields one outcome), and distinguishability-preserving (orthogonal states yield perfectly distinguishable outcomes; non-orthogonal states do not - exactly matching the IIS distinction between determinate and indeterminate structure).

**Other structures** - real Hilbert spaces, quaternionic quantum mechanics, generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), and even super-quantum models like PR-boxes - also satisfy the formal constraints.

### 7.4 The Selection Problem

If multiple structures satisfy the formal interface constraints, what selects among them?

This question is fundamental. Logic alone does not answer it. The interface constraints are necessary conditions for mediating between IIS and Boolean actuality, but they are not sufficient to uniquely determine the interface structure.

Three possible answers present themselves:

**Logical necessity:** Perhaps quantum mechanics is uniquely determined by some further logical or symmetry constraint we have not yet identified. This is the "derive QM from axioms alone" program pursued by Hardy, Chiribella-D'Ariano-Perinotti, and other reconstruction approaches.

**Brute contingency:** Perhaps quantum structure is simply the way our universe happens to be, with no deeper explanation. The selection is a brute fact.

**Stability selection:** Perhaps quantum structure is selected because it alone produces stable physics - atoms, chemistry, observers capable of inquiry. Other structures satisfy the formal constraints but produce no stable matter.

LRT defends the third answer. We do not claim that quantum mechanics is logically necessary. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique structure compatible with stable physical existence. This is a **selection claim**, not a derivation claim.

### 7.5 Why Selection Is Not Derivation

The distinction between selection and derivation is crucial for honest assessment of LRT's claims.

**Derivation** would mean: given only 3FLL and IIS, quantum mechanics follows by logical necessity. No empirical input is required. This is what LRT does *not* claim.

**Selection** means: given that actuality requires Boolean outcomes and that stable structures capable of causal persistence exist, quantum mechanics is the unique interface structure that produces both. The existence of stable structures is an empirical fact; the uniqueness of quantum structure as a stability condition is a theoretical claim subject to analysis.

This distinction matters because:

1. It preserves LRT's empirical vulnerability. If another structure were shown to produce stable physics, LRT's selection claim would be falsified. This makes the interface claim strictly empirical, not purely philosophical.

2. It correctly locates the fine-tuning. The fine-tuning is not in the logical laws themselves but in the selection of quantum structure from among the logically permissible options.

3. It explains why quantum mechanics has its specific form without claiming that form is logically inevitable.

### 7.6 Parsimony as Derived

One might ask: among the structures satisfying the interface constraints, why should actuality select the minimal one? Is parsimony an additional assumption?

No. Parsimony is derived from more fundamental commitments already internal to LRT.

The derivation proceeds as follows:

**Step 1: Constitution versus Constraint.** 3FLL do not merely *constrain* actuality (ruling out some configurations while permitting others). They *constitute* actuality - they generate the very structure within which determinate being is possible. This is LRT's core claim from Part I.

**Step 2: Constitutive Closure.** If principle P constitutes domain D, then D contains exactly the structure P generates - no more, no less. This follows the same pattern as mathematical axioms: the structure of the domain is nothing over and above what the axioms generate.

**Step 3: Truthmaker Requirement.** For any proposition in actuality to have a genuine Boolean value (not merely a stipulated one), something must ground that value. No proposition in actuality can have a free-floating truth value; every fact must be grounded. The grounding sources within LRT's minimal ontology are: logical necessity from 3FLL, logical entailment from grounded propositions, initial conditions, and propagation through derived dynamics.

**Step 4: Surplus Structure Excluded.** Any proposition not grounded by these sources cannot have a genuine Boolean value. But actuality requires genuine Boolean values. Therefore, surplus propositions are not just pruned - they are impossible within actuality.

**Conclusion:** Actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions - those whose Boolean values are determined by (3FLL + initial conditions) and their consequences. No surplus structure exists.

This is **Global Parsimony** - not as a methodological preference but as a structural consequence of what "actuality" means given LRT's constitutive architecture. The formal statement and proof appear in Part III.

### 7.7 The Path Forward

The interface problem now has a clear structure:

1. Actuality requires Boolean outcomes (from 3FLL enforcement)
2. Multiple structures can provide Boolean outcomes (classical, quantum, others)
3. Only quantum structure produces stable physics (selection claim)
4. Therefore, quantum structure is what we observe

The next sections develop each element of this argument:
- Section 8 analyzes the bit as the fundamental unit of distinguishability
- Section 9 examines why quantum structure specifically produces stability, showing how reconstruction theorems, stability arguments, and physical fine-tuning converge
- Section 10 addresses the Born rule
- Sections 11-15 develop implications and comparisons

---

## 8. Distinguishability and the Bit

The interface problem asks what structure mediates between IIS and Boolean actuality. Before examining candidate structures, we must analyze what distinguishability itself requires. This section establishes that the **bit** - the minimal unit of distinction - is constituted by 3FLL, and that this constitution has structural implications for any interface.

### 8.1 Distinguishability Is Constituted by 3FLL

Distinguishability is not a primitive fact discovered in the world. It is what 3FLL establish.

Consider what is required for state A to be distinguishable from state B:

- **Identity:** A = A and B = B. Each state must be determinately itself.
- **Non-identity:** A ≠ B. The states must differ. (Note: non-identity is not a separate logical law but is logically definable only because Identity and Non-Contradiction hold.)
- **Non-contradiction:** It is not the case that A = B and A ≠ B simultaneously.

Without these conditions, there is no basis for one state to be different from another. Distinguishability just *is* the application of 3FLL to a domain. This is why IIS is "constituted by" 3FLL rather than merely "constrained by" them - the very possibility of distinct states depends on logical structure.

Distinguishability exists at the level of IIS; actuality enforces only one branch of each distinction. This reinforces the asymmetry: IIS contains all distinguishable configurations, while actuality selects among them.

### 8.2 Distinguishability Is Pairwise

To distinguish is to compare. Distinguishability is inherently a relation between two things: how different is A from B?

This relational character means distinguishability naturally takes a **bilinear or quadratic mathematical form** - it involves pairs, not individuals. You do not ask "how distinguishable is A?" in isolation. You ask "how distinguishable is A from B?" The question is inherently comparative.

This observation is crucial for understanding quantum structure. The Born rule gives probabilities as $|\langle\psi|\phi\rangle|^2$ - the squared magnitude of an inner product between two states. This quadratic form is not accidental. It reflects the pairwise nature of distinguishability itself. The amplitude (inner product) captures the intrinsic relation between states; the squared magnitude yields the Boolean decision (probability of outcome).

Similarly, the inner product structure of Hilbert space - where states are characterized by their overlaps with other states - instantiates the relational character of distinction. States in quantum mechanics are not defined by intrinsic properties alone but by their relations to measurement bases and to each other.

### 8.3 The Bit as Fundamental Unit

The **bit** is the minimal unit of distinguishability - one binary distinction, a single yes/no question answered.

In LRT terms:

- **One bit** = the information required to distinguish between exactly two alternatives
- **Physical law reflects and instantiates the bit-structure** - it does not generate it. The logical structure of distinction is prior to the physical structures that instantiate it.
- **The grain of actuality is the bit** - you cannot have half a distinction. A proposition is either true or false; a state either obtains or does not. (In IIS, we can have partial or indeterminate structure; in actuality, distinctions are always Boolean.)

This connects directly to Wheeler's "it from bit" thesis: physical reality emerges from yes/no questions, from binary distinctions accumulated and related. LRT grounds this insight by showing that the yes/no question is the fundamental logical operation, and 3FLL constitute what makes such questions meaningful.

Wheeler wrote: "Every it - every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself - derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely... from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits" (Wheeler, 1990).

LRT explains *why* this is so: the bit is the atomic unit of 3FLL-constituted distinguishability. Physical reality must be Boolean at the level of actuality, and the bit is the minimal Boolean structure.

### 8.4 The Bit Scale

If the bit is the fundamental unit of distinguishability, and physical action is measured in units of ℏ (Planck's constant), then ℏ may be understood as the **conversion factor between logical and physical structure**:

$$S = \hbar \cdot C$$

Where S is action (physical) and C is complexity (informational, measured in bits).

This identification is conjectural. LRT does not require S = ℏC for its philosophical foundation, but this conjecture makes the link between logical and physical structure quantitatively precise. It receives support from independent results:

**The Bekenstein bound** states that the maximum entropy (information content) of a region is proportional to its surface area in Planck units:

$$S_{\text{max}} = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 G \hbar}$$

This is naturally interpreted as a maximum bit density of roughly one bit per Planck area. If ℏ is the bit-action conversion factor, this bound follows naturally: physical regions have finite action capacity, hence finite bit capacity.

**Black hole entropy** (the Bekenstein-Hawking formula) gives entropy proportional to horizon area in Planck units. In LRT terms: the horizon encodes the maximum distinguishability available to degrees of freedom associated with that region. A black hole of area A can contain at most A/(4ℓ²_P) bits of information.

**The holographic principle** generalizes this: the information content of any region is bounded by its boundary area, not its volume. This constraint appears as a physical limit but is equally interpretable as a limit on distinguishability-granularity if the bit is ontologically fundamental. Reality cannot support arbitrary information density because distinguishability itself has finite granularity.

### 8.5 Implications for Physical Structure

These connections suggest several conclusions (conditional on S = ℏC where noted):

1. **If S = ℏC, then one bit of complexity corresponds to approximately ℏ of action.** This sets the scale at which logical structure becomes physically manifest.

2. **The classical world appears continuous because specifying it exactly would require infinite bits at the level of description.** Continuity is an approximation that breaks down at scales where the bit-structure of distinguishability becomes directly relevant. This is a claim about description, not about ontology.

3. **The Planck scale marks the regime where the finite bit-structure of distinguishability becomes non-negligible.** At lengths of order ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³), the discrete structure can no longer be ignored relative to our measurements. This reflects the finite distinguishability capacity of physical structure.

4. **Quantum discreteness reflects bit-structure.** Energy levels, angular momentum quantization, and other discrete quantum features arise from Hilbert-space algebra and boundary conditions. This does not conflict with the bit interpretation; the algebra itself instantiates the finite-granularity of distinguishability.

5. **The quadratic structure of probability (Born rule) reflects pairwise distinguishability.** This connection is developed further in Section 10.

### 8.6 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Distinguishability is constituted by 3FLL, not discovered independently
- Distinguishability is inherently pairwise, giving it quadratic structure
- The bit is the minimal unit of this structure
- Physical constants (ℏ) may encode the conversion between logical and physical domains
- Several independent results (Bekenstein bound, holography) support this picture

This prepares the ground for Section 9, which asks: among the structures that can interface with Boolean actuality, why does quantum mechanics - with its specific Hilbert space, inner product, and Born rule structure - produce stable physics while others do not? The answer will show that quantum mechanics, and not classical probability or any other generalized probabilistic theory, is the unique stable structure compatible with this bit-based distinguishability architecture.

---

## 9. Why Quantum Structure

Section 7 established that multiple mathematical structures satisfy the interface constraints between IIS and Boolean actuality. Section 8 showed that any interface must respect the pairwise, bit-based character of distinguishability. This section asks: why does physical reality exhibit quantum structure specifically, rather than classical probability or some other generalized probabilistic theory?

The answer is **stability selection**: quantum mechanics is the unique structure that produces stable physical existence. This is not a derivation but a selection effect - and we must be precise about what this means.

### 9.1 Classical Structure Is Compatible but Unstable

Classical probability satisfies the formal interface constraints. A probability distribution over outcomes, sampled to yield a definite result, produces Boolean actuality from a richer structure. Formally, classical probability is a valid interface.

But classical mechanics - whether deterministic or supplemented by classical probability - does not produce stable physics at the atomic scale:

- **No stable atoms.** Electrons would spiral into nuclei. The classical Bohr model fails precisely because orbiting charges radiate energy continuously.
- **No discrete energy levels.** Without quantization, no chemistry - bonding requires discrete orbital structures.
- **No tunneling.** Without quantum tunneling, no stellar fusion - stars cannot ignite.
- **No identical particles.** Without quantum statistics (Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac), no periodic table - the structure of matter collapses.

Classical structure satisfies the Boolean interface constraint but does not produce observers capable of noticing. A universe with classical fundamental structure would contain no stable matter, no chemistry, no life, no inquiry.

### 9.2 Quantum Structure Produces Stability

Quantum mechanics - specifically, complex Hilbert space with unitary evolution and the Born rule - produces:

- **Stable atoms.** Discrete energy levels arise from the spectral properties of self-adjoint Hamiltonians - wave interference in bound states. Electrons occupy orbitals, not arbitrary positions.
- **Chemistry.** Electron orbitals, bonding, molecular structure - all depend on quantum discreteness and interference.
- **Solid matter.** The Pauli exclusion principle (fermion statistics) prevents matter from collapsing. Electrons cannot all occupy the lowest energy state.
- **Stars.** Quantum tunneling enables nuclear fusion at temperatures far below the classical Coulomb barrier.
- **Observers.** Stable structures capable of inquiry, measurement, and asking questions about the interface.

### 9.3 The Fine-Tuning of Quantum Structure

The relationship between quantum structure and physical stability is not logically necessary - it is fine-tuned. Perturbations to quantum structure destroy stability:

| Perturbation | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Remove complex numbers | Lose full interference structure and compositional consistency; no stable microphysics |
| Alter unitarity | Norms blow up or decay; no stable evolution |
| Change Born exponent from 2 | No valid probability measure (Gleason) |
| Use quaternions instead | Lose tomographic locality in multi-system composition |
| Use reals instead | Lose local tomography; effectively classical |
| Perturb linearity | Non-linear evolution generically violates no-signaling (Gisin, 1990) |
| Alter commutation relations | Pathological spectra; no stable matter |
| Remove Hilbert completeness | No well-defined dynamics |

Quantum mechanics sits on a razor's edge. The mathematical structure must be exactly as it is for physics to be stable. This is not a claim about adjustable parameters within quantum mechanics; it is a claim about the mathematical framework itself.

### 9.4 Evidence from Reconstruction Theorems

The uniqueness of quantum structure is not merely asserted - it is supported by rigorous results in quantum foundations:

**Hardy (2001):** Derived quantum theory from five "reasonable axioms" including continuous reversibility and tomographic locality. Result: only quantum mechanics satisfies all five.

**Chiribella, D'Ariano, Perinotti (2011):** Derived quantum theory from informational axioms. Key finding: quantum theory is the unique theory satisfying causality, perfect distinguishability, ideal compression, local distinguishability, and pure conditioning.

**Masanes and Müller (2011):** Showed quantum theory is uniquely characterized by:
- Continuous reversible dynamics
- Local tomography (state determined by local measurements)
- Existence of entangled states

**Dakić and Brukner (2011):** Derived quantum theory from three axioms about information capacity and continuity.

These reconstruction theorems converge on the same conclusion: quantum mechanics is not one possibility among many but the **unique** structure satisfying certain natural constraints. GPT models with stronger-than-quantum correlations (such as PR-boxes) violate either continuous dynamics or compositional consistency - they satisfy some constraints but fail others.

In LRT terms: the constraints these theorems identify are features required for stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. Continuous reversibility preserves distinguishability in IIS. Local tomography ensures consistency across subsystems. The theorems do not derive quantum mechanics from logic alone, but they show that quantum structure is uniquely determined once reasonable interface requirements are imposed.

### 9.5 Stability Selection, Not Derivation

We must be explicit about the logical status of this argument:

1. IIS contains many possible structures (classical, quantum, real, quaternionic, GPTs, PR-boxes, etc.)
2. Multiple structures satisfy the formal interface constraints
3. Only quantum structure produces stable atoms, chemistry, and long-lived information-bearing structures
4. We inhabit a universe capable of sustaining such structures
5. Therefore we observe quantum structure

This has the form of the **Weak Anthropic Principle**: we necessarily find ourselves in conditions compatible with our existence. Critics may object that this is circular or tautological.

The response: we are not claiming quantum structure is *logically necessary*. We are claiming it is *observationally necessary* - necessary for there to be stable information-bearing structures at all. This is selection, not derivation.

The selection is genuine:
- IIS contains many possible interface structures
- Most do not produce stable matter
- The ones that do are the ones that can be observed
- Quantum structure is the unique stable option

This parallels cosmic fine-tuning arguments. We do not derive the value of the fine-structure constant α from first principles. We note that if α were significantly different, no stable atoms would form - and therefore no observers to measure α. The "explanation" is selection, not derivation.

### 9.6 Structural Fine-Tuning

LRT adds something to standard fine-tuning discussions: it situates the selection at the level of **mathematical structure**, not just parameters.

**Cosmic fine-tuning** concerns constants: if the fine-structure constant α were slightly different, no stable atoms. If the cosmological constant Λ were much larger, no galaxies.

**Structural fine-tuning** concerns the mathematical framework itself: if the structure of quantum mechanics were perturbed, no stable physics at all.

Structural fine-tuning is more fundamental. Structural fine-tuning constrains the mathematical space of viable physical theories; parameter fine-tuning occurs *within* such a structure. The framework itself must be precisely right for any parameters to matter. You cannot ask "what if α were different?" unless quantum mechanics holds to give α meaning.

The question "why quantum mechanics?" becomes parallel to "why these constants?" Both are fine-tuning facts, with structural fine-tuning being logically prior. Constants require a framework; frameworks do not require constants.

### 9.7 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Classical structure satisfies interface constraints but produces no stable matter
- Quantum structure is the unique interface that produces physical stability
- Reconstruction theorems independently confirm quantum uniqueness
- The explanation is selection (anthropic), not derivation (logical)
- Structural fine-tuning is more fundamental than cosmic fine-tuning

LRT does not claim to explain *why* quantum structure exists. It claims to explain *why we observe it*: because it is the unique structure compatible with stable information-bearing structures existing to ask the question.

To complete the interface story, we must now understand why the mapping from relational structure to Boolean outcomes takes the quadratic form expressed by the Born rule. The next section addresses this: why does the probability measure take the form $|\langle\psi|\phi\rangle|^2$, and how does this connect to the pairwise structure of distinguishability?

---

## 10. The Born Rule

The Born rule states that the probability of obtaining outcome |φ⟩ when measuring a system in state |ψ⟩ is:

$$P(\phi|\psi) = |\langle\phi|\psi\rangle|^2$$

This is the central probabilistic law of quantum mechanics. Why does it have this specific form? This section shows that the Born rule is not an arbitrary postulate but follows from the structure of Hilbert space - which in turn reflects the pairwise character of distinguishability established in Section 8.

### 10.1 From Pairwise Distinguishability to Inner Product

Section 8 established that distinguishability is inherently pairwise: to distinguish is to compare. This relational character means that the natural mathematical structure on a space of distinguishable states is an **inner product** - a function that takes two vectors and returns a number measuring their relation.

For complex Hilbert space, the inner product is:

$$\langle\psi|\phi\rangle$$

This inner product is **sesquilinear** (linear in one argument, conjugate-linear in the other) and **positive-definite**. Together these properties ensure:

$$\langle\psi|\psi\rangle \geq 0$$

The norm-squared is non-negative - a requirement for any quantity that will become a probability.

The connection to distinguishability is direct:
- **Orthogonal states** (⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0) are perfectly distinguishable
- **Identical states** (|ψ⟩ = |φ⟩, up to phase) are completely indistinguishable
- **Non-orthogonal states** have partial distinguishability, measured by |⟨ψ|φ⟩|²

The inner product encodes the relational structure of distinguishability in IIS. It is the unique structure that captures pairwise relational distinguishability continuously and compatibly with composition.

### 10.2 Gleason's Theorem: The Born Rule Is Unique

Given a Hilbert space structure, what probability measures are possible? This is not a question of preference but of mathematical necessity.

**Gleason's theorem** (1957) provides the answer: in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of dimension ≥ 3, the only probability measure that assigns values to all projection operators in a non-contextual way is:

$$P(E) = \text{Tr}(\rho E)$$

For pure states ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and projectors E = |φ⟩⟨φ|, this reduces to:

$$P(\phi|\psi) = |\langle\phi|\psi\rangle|^2$$

This is the Born rule. It is not an additional postulate grafted onto quantum mechanics - it is the **unique** way to assign probabilities to outcomes within Hilbert space framework.

The theorem's assumptions are minimal:
- Probabilities are non-negative real numbers
- Probabilities sum to 1 for complete sets of outcomes
- The probability assigned to a projector depends only on the projector and the state, not on which other projectors are measured alongside it (non-contextuality of probability values - this is weaker than the Kochen-Specker notion of non-contextuality for hidden variables)

Any other probability rule would violate one of these requirements.

Importantly, this result is independent of interpretation: hidden-variable, many-worlds, and operational approaches all inherit the Born rule from Hilbert-space geometry.

### 10.3 Why the Squared Magnitude?

The Born rule involves |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² - the squared magnitude of the inner product. Why squared, not linear or some other power?

Several considerations converge on this answer:

**Mathematical:** The inner product ⟨ψ|φ⟩ is complex-valued. Probabilities must be real and non-negative. The squared magnitude |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² is the unique non-negative, basis-independent function compatible with the inner-product structure and with Gleason consistency.

**Physical:** Gleason's theorem shows that no other power works. If probabilities were proportional to |⟨ψ|φ⟩|^n for n ≠ 2, the additivity requirement for probabilities would fail. The exponent 2 is not a choice; it is forced.

**Structural:** The squared magnitude reflects the two-level structure of the interface:
- The amplitude ⟨ψ|φ⟩ captures the intrinsic relation between states in IIS
- The squared magnitude |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² yields the Boolean decision (probability of outcome in actuality)

The amplitude lives in IIS; the probability lives at the interface with Boolean actuality. Squaring is the operation that converts relational structure to Boolean-compatible measure.

### 10.4 The Conditionality of the Derivation

We must be precise about the logical structure here:

**Given Hilbert space structure:** The Born rule follows by Gleason's theorem. It is mathematically *derived*, not postulated.

**Hilbert space structure itself:** Fine-tuned, not derived. Section 9 showed that complex Hilbert space is *selected* by stability considerations from among interface structures compatible with 3FLL and distinguishability.

So the full picture is:

1. 3FLL constitute IIS (foundational)
2. Boolean actuality requires an interface (from 3FLL enforcement)
3. Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface (selection, Section 9)
4. Given quantum mechanics, the Born rule is unique (derivation, Gleason)

The Born rule is derived *conditional on* Hilbert space structure. Hilbert space structure is selected *from among* logically possible interfaces. The derivation is genuine but conditional.

### 10.5 What About Dimension 2?

Gleason's theorem requires dimension ≥ 3. What about qubits (dimension 2)?

In dimension 2, Gleason's theorem does not apply directly - there exist other mathematically consistent probability assignments. However:

- Physical systems are never truly isolated qubits; they are subsystems of larger systems
- Composite systems have dimension ≥ 4, where Gleason applies
- Any physically meaningful qubit participates in larger composite systems; the Born rule is fixed by requiring consistency under tensor-product composition

The restriction to dimension ≥ 3 is a technical artifact, not a physical limitation. In any realistic physical context, the Born rule remains unique.

### 10.6 Connection to Information Theory

The Born rule has deep connections to information-theoretic principles:

**Optimal state discrimination:** Helstrom's theorem (Helstrom, 1976) shows the Born rule yields the maximal probability of correctly distinguishing quantum states. No other probability rule achieves better discrimination.

**No-cloning constraint:** The specific form |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² is connected to the impossibility of perfectly copying unknown quantum states. Alternative probability rules either violate linearity (allowing cloning) or violate unitary reversibility (destroying information).

**Entropy and information:** Von Neumann entropy, defined using the Born rule, has all the properties required of an information measure. Information capacity limits such as the Holevo bound (Holevo, 1973) presuppose the Born rule and fail under alternative rules.

These connections suggest that the Born rule is not just mathematically unique but informationally optimal - the natural way to extract Boolean outcomes from a structure designed to preserve distinguishability.

### 10.7 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- The inner product structure reflects pairwise distinguishability
- Gleason's theorem proves the Born rule is the unique probability measure on Hilbert space
- The squared magnitude is forced by mathematical and physical constraints
- The derivation is conditional on Hilbert space structure (which is itself fine-tuned)
- Information-theoretic considerations independently support the Born rule's form

The Born rule is not mysterious or arbitrary. Given the relational structure of distinguishability (Section 8) and the unique stability of quantum structure (Section 9), the Born rule is the only possible interface between quantum states and Boolean outcomes.

The next sections address how LRT dissolves foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics - measurement, entanglement, and wave function reality - using the framework now established.

## 11. Dissolving Foundational Puzzles

LRT does not solve the foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics in the sense of providing new dynamics or hidden variables. It **dissolves** them - showing that the puzzles arise from mistaken framings. Once the IIS/actuality distinction is understood, several long-standing problems cease to be puzzling.

### 11.1 The Measurement Problem

**The puzzle:** How does the smooth, deterministic evolution of the wave function produce discrete, random measurement outcomes? What constitutes a "measurement"? When does "collapse" occur?

**The dissolution:** There is no mysterious collapse mechanism. Measurement is the interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. LRT treats measurement not as a primitive but as whatever physical process forces Boolean enforcement.

In IIS, the quantum state evolves unitarily - smoothly and deterministically. When the state interacts with a context that requires Boolean outcomes - a detector, an irreversible record, a macroscopic system - 3FLL are enforced. The state must become determinate.

This is not a dynamical process requiring new physics. It is a **category transition** - from the IIS domain (where indeterminacy is permitted) to the actuality domain (where it is not). The "measurement problem" dissolves because collapse is not a process but an interface. The question "when does collapse occur?" is like asking "when does the map become the territory?" - it reflects a category confusion.

**What LRT provides:**
- An ontological interpretation of what collapse IS (category transition, not dynamical process)
- An explanation of why definite outcomes occur (3FLL enforcement)
- A reason why no new physics is needed (it is not a physical process)

**What LRT does not provide:**
- A precise physical criterion for when the transition occurs (though candidates include decoherence, irreversibility, thermodynamic gradients)
- A derivation of the quantum-classical boundary
- An explanation of why THIS outcome rather than THAT outcome (nor does any interpretation - nothing requires explanation for "which branch")

The question "when exactly does Boolean actuality get enforced?" remains open. Candidate physical criteria include decoherence (Zurek, 2003; Schlosshauer, 2007), irreversible amplification, thermodynamic gradients, gravitational thresholds (Penrose, 1996), and information transfer to the environment (Quantum Darwinism). LRT is compatible with any of these as the physical marker of the transition. What LRT adds is the interpretation: whatever the physical criterion, what happens is category transition, not collapse dynamics.

The remaining question - why THIS outcome? - may have no answer. If selection among outcomes satisfying 3FLL is genuinely stochastic, then "why this one?" has no deeper explanation. The Born rule gives probabilities; it may not admit further grounding.

### 11.2 Entanglement and Non-Locality

**The puzzle:** Entangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables (Bell, 1964). Measuring one particle seems to instantaneously affect the other, regardless of distance. How can this be, given that no signal travels faster than light?

**The dissolution:** There is no "spooky action at a distance" because there is no action.

In LRT, 3FLL operate as a **global logical constraint** (not a physical field - the term "field" is metaphorical). They do not propagate from place to place like a signal; they simply hold, everywhere, always. An entangled state is a single joint configuration in IIS - not two separate things mysteriously connected, but one extended state with non-factorizable structure.

When measurement occurs, 3FLL enforce consistency across the entire state. The correlations are not caused by one particle signaling the other; they are **constraint satisfaction**, not communication.

**Constraints are not hidden variables.** This distinction is crucial:

- A **variable** has a value. Hidden variable theories posit that particles have definite properties we simply do not know. The "hidden" refers to our ignorance.
- A **constraint** is a rule. The constraint "A + B = 0" does not assign values to A and B; it specifies a relationship they must satisfy. If we measure A = 3, we immediately know B = -3 - not because a signal traveled, but because the constraint was always in force.

Bell's theorem rules out local hidden *variables* - pre-existing definite values. LRT does not posit such values. The IIS state is genuinely indeterminate; constraints specify relationships between outcomes, not the outcomes themselves.

This explains why entanglement produces correlations but not signaling. The correlations reflect the logical structure of a unified state. No information travels because there is nothing traveling - just global consistency being enforced. The marginal statistics at each location remain unchanged regardless of what measurement is performed at the other - no-signaling is preserved precisely because the joint configuration already contains the constraint; measurement merely reveals it.

### 11.3 Many-Worlds Obviated

**The puzzle:** If the wave function is real and collapse is not fundamental, what happens to the other branches? The Many-Worlds Interpretation says they are equally real - parallel worlds splitting at every measurement.

**The dissolution:** LRT preserves MWI's insights while restoring single actuality.

MWI correctly recognized that:
- The wave function is ontologically real
- Collapse should not be a special mechanism
- There are no hidden variables

LRT agrees with all of this. But LRT does not conclude that all branches are equally actual. Instead:

- **Possibilities are real** - they exist in IIS as modal structure, not parallel actualized worlds
- **One actuality** - 3FLL enforce a single determinate outcome (single actuality follows directly from Non-Contradiction and Excluded Middle)
- **Other possibilities remain in IIS**, not in parallel branches - they are possibilities that did not actualize, not alternative actualities

The "branching" of MWI is reinterpreted as the structure of IIS - all possibilities are there, but only one actualizes. This is not solipsism or hidden variables; it is the distinction between possibility (IIS) and actuality (3FLL-compliant Boolean structure).

### 11.4 Wave Function Reality

**The puzzle:** Is the wave function real (ontological) or merely a description of our knowledge (epistemic)?

**The dissolution:** The wave function is IIS structure - real but not actual.

The wave function ψ describes a genuine configuration in IIS. It is not "just math" or "just our knowledge." But it is also not a physical thing in space like a classical field - it is ontologically real but not spatiotemporally located.

The wave function is real in the sense that IIS is real - it is the structure of possibility constituted by 3FLL. It becomes actual only at the interface, when measurement enforces Boolean determinacy. This position is neither ψ-ontic (wave function as physical substance) nor ψ-epistemic (wave function as mere knowledge) but something distinct: **ψ-structural** (wave function as IIS configuration).

This is compatible with the PBR theorem (Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph, 2012), which rules out ψ-epistemic interpretations where quantum states represent ignorance of underlying ontic states. LRT's ψ-structural position agrees that the wave function is not mere ignorance - it genuinely represents structure in IIS - while denying that this structure is spatiotemporal substance.

### 11.5 Quantization

**The puzzle:** Why are physical quantities (energy, charge, spin) discrete rather than continuous?

**The dissolution:** Actuality is Boolean; the bit is the grain.

In IIS, continuous structures exist. But actuality - what physically manifests - must be determinate. The bit is the minimal unit of determinacy. You cannot have 0.7 of a distinction.

Discrete quantities reflect the Boolean structure of actuality:
- Energy levels are discrete because bound-state boundary conditions select specific eigenvalues - the electron either is or is not in a given eigenstate
- Charge is quantized because U(1) gauge symmetry produces discrete representations - particles carry integer multiples of the fundamental charge
- Spin is quantized because SU(2) representations are discrete - measurement outcomes are eigenvalues of angular momentum operators

Quantization is 3FLL at work - the enforcement of determinate, non-contradictory, complete structure at the level of actuality.

### 11.6 Identical Particles

**The puzzle:** Why are all electrons exactly identical? Classical objects can be arbitrarily similar but always distinguishable in principle. Quantum particles of the same type are absolutely indistinguishable.

**The dissolution:** Quantum fields are modes of distinguishability in IIS.

In LRT, quantum fields are not substances but structures - they represent the different ways distinctions can be made within IIS. All electrons are identical because they are excitations of the same distinguishability mode (the electron field). There is no "this electron" versus "that electron" at the fundamental level - there is only "electron-mode excitation here" versus "electron-mode excitation there."

The identity of particles follows from the structure of distinguishability itself. What we call "an electron" is a quantum of the electron distinguishability mode - a pattern of distinction, not an individual substance. This explains both perfect identity (same mode) and the statistics (bosonic modes allow unlimited occupation; fermionic modes do not).

### 11.7 What This Section Establishes

LRT dissolves foundational puzzles by reframing them:

| Puzzle | Traditional Framing | LRT Dissolution |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Measurement | Dynamical collapse | Category transition |
| Entanglement | Spooky action | Global constraint satisfaction |
| Many-Worlds | Branching realities | Single actuality, IIS possibilities |
| Wave function | Ontic vs epistemic | IIS structure (real but not actual) |
| Quantization | Why discrete? | Boolean actuality requires it |
| Identical particles | Why identical? | Modes of distinguishability |

These dissolutions do not resolve every question. They reframe the questions in terms of the IIS/actuality distinction, showing that many "puzzles" arise from conflating these domains.

The common thread: the IIS/actuality divide does most of the philosophical work. Superposition exists in IIS; definite outcomes exist in actuality. The wave function describes IIS structure; measurements reveal actuality. Possibilities are real in IIS; only one actualizes. Once this divide is taken seriously, the puzzles dissolve into category distinctions rather than dynamical mysteries.

The next sections examine quantum fields, fine-tuning, and LRT's relationship to other foundational programs.

## 12. Quantum Fields and Emergence

Section 11 dissolved foundational puzzles by distinguishing IIS from actuality. This section develops how quantum fields fit into the framework - not as fundamental substances but as emergent structures in the hierarchy from logic to observable particles.

### 12.1 The Emergence Hierarchy

LRT articulates a hierarchy from logical foundation to observable physics:

| Level | Description | Ontological Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0: 3FLL | Ontological foundation | Constitutive primitive |
| 1: IIS | Structural space | Co-primitive with 3FLL |
| 2: Hilbert Space | Geometric structure | Selected interface |
| 3: Quantum Fields | Dynamic structure | Excitation modes |
| 4: Particles | Phenomenological | Localized excitations |

Note the progression: from constitutive → selected → contingent → phenomenological. Each level is real and physically serious, but the ontological grounding shifts as we move down the hierarchy.

This inverts the usual picture. Standard physics thinks: particles are fundamental; fields describe their interactions; Hilbert space is mathematical formalism; logic is how we reason about results.

LRT reverses this: logic is foundational; IIS is what logical distinguishability generates; Hilbert space is what distinguishability looks like when stability-selected; fields are modes of excitation; particles are what we observe when fields are locally excited.

### 12.2 Quantum Fields as Distinguishability Modes

At Level 3, quantum fields are physical structures that implement particular **modes of distinguishability** in IIS. Each field represents a particular way that distinctions can be made:

- The **electron field** represents a mode where distinctions carry electric charge, spin-1/2, and lepton number
- The **photon field** represents a mode where distinctions carry spin-1, zero mass, and mediate electromagnetic interaction
- The **quark fields** represent modes with fractional charge, color charge, and baryon number

The mathematical structures describing these fields (spinor fields, gauge fields, etc.) are not arbitrary - they encode how these modes transform under Lorentz and internal gauge symmetries via unitary representations.

### 12.3 Particles as Local Excitations

At Level 4, particles are what we observe when fields have localized excitations:

- An **electron** is a quantum of excitation in the electron distinguishability mode
- A **photon** is a quantum of excitation in the photon distinguishability mode
- A **quark** is a quantum of excitation in a quark distinguishability mode

This explains why particles are countable (discrete excitation numbers), why identical particles are truly identical (same mode), and why particle physics has the structure it does (mode-mixing, creation/annihilation).

The particle concept is not fundamental - it is *emergent*: accurate and indispensable at many scales, but derivative of field structure. What we call "an electron" is really "one unit of excitation in the electron mode of distinguishability." At high energies or in extreme conditions, the particle picture breaks down and the field picture becomes essential.

### 12.4 The Standard Model Structure

The Standard Model describes:
- **Gauge symmetries:** U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3)
- **Matter fields:** Three generations of quarks and leptons
- **Interaction fields:** Photon, W/Z bosons, gluons
- **Higgs field:** Generates masses through spontaneous symmetry breaking

In LRT terms, this structure represents the specific distinguishability modes that exist in our universe. The gauge symmetries encode how distinctions transform; the matter fields represent fermionic modes; the interaction fields mediate relationships between modes.

LRT does not alter Standard Model dynamics; it reinterprets their place in the logical hierarchy.

### 12.5 What LRT Does Not Explain About Fields

The hierarchy situates quantum fields within the logical framework but does not derive their specifics. LRT does not explain:

- **Why THESE specific fields** - why electron, quark, photon rather than others
- **Why THESE gauge groups** - why U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) rather than some other symmetry
- **Why THREE generations** - why three copies of the matter structure
- **Why THESE masses** - the specific values of particle masses
- **Why THESE coupling constants** - the specific strengths of interactions

These represent further fine-tuning beyond structural fine-tuning. LRT shows that quantum structure is necessary for stable physics; it does not show why quantum structure has these particular field contents. These remain as open targets for deeper unification or further selection principles beyond those articulated here.

### 12.6 The Emergence Question

A natural question: how do higher levels emerge from lower levels?

**Level 0 → Level 1:** IIS is co-constituted with 3FLL. There is no "emergence" here - they are mutually constitutive primitives.

**Level 1 → Level 2:** Hilbert space structure is selected by stability from among IIS structures that can interface with Boolean actuality. This is selection, not derivation.

**Level 2 → Level 3:** Quantum fields arise as dynamical structures on Hilbert space via representations of symmetry groups and local field operators that encode how distinguishability modes behave.

**Level 3 → Level 4:** Particles emerge phenomenologically when fields have localized excitations that can be counted and tracked.

The transitions from Level 2 onward involve progressively more contingent structure. Logic alone does not determine Hilbert space; Hilbert space alone does not determine which fields exist; fields alone do not determine particle phenomena.

### 12.7 Relationship to Effective Field Theory

Modern particle physics uses **effective field theory (EFT)**: describing physics at a given energy scale without requiring complete knowledge of higher-energy structure. At each scale, appropriate degrees of freedom and symmetries suffice.

LRT is compatible with EFT. The hierarchy (logic → IIS → Hilbert space → fields → particles) does not require deriving lower levels from higher ones. Each level can be described in its own terms while recognizing its place in the larger structure. LRT is compatible with multiple EFT descriptions at different scales; the logical hierarchy does not require a single micro-theory to be explicitly known.

The question "what is fundamental?" receives a nuanced answer: 3FLL and IIS are constitutively fundamental; Hilbert space is stability-selected fundamental; fields and particles are phenomenologically fundamental at appropriate scales.

### 12.8 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Quantum fields are modes of distinguishability, not fundamental substances
- Particles are localized excitations of these modes
- The hierarchy from logic to particles inverts the usual picture
- The Standard Model structure represents contingent fine-tuning beyond quantum structure
- LRT is compatible with effective field theory methods

The next section develops the fine-tuning thesis more systematically, showing how structural fine-tuning relates to the familiar cosmic fine-tuning of constants.

---

## 13. The Fine-Tuning Thesis

Fine-tuning is typically discussed in terms of cosmic constants - if the fine-structure constant α or the cosmological constant Λ were slightly different, no stable atoms or galaxies would form. LRT reveals a deeper level: **structural fine-tuning** - the mathematical framework itself must be precisely as it is for any physics to exist.

### 13.1 Three Levels of Fine-Tuning

| Level | What Is Tuned | Examples | Status in LRT |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Constants** | Parameters within QM + GR | α, G, Λ, particle masses | Contingent |
| **Structure** | Mathematical framework | Complex Hilbert space, Born rule, unitarity | Fine-tuned (selected) |
| **Logic** | 3FLL themselves | Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle | Constitutive (not tuned) |

Standard fine-tuning discussions focus on Level 1. LRT reveals Level 2: the framework itself is fine-tuned in the sense that perturbations destroy physics.

Level 3 is not fine-tuned in the same sense. From within LRT, 3FLL are constitutive; treating them as "one option among many logics" presupposes the very distinguishability they make possible. 3FLL are the condition for any structure at all. Asking "why 3FLL?" is like asking "why is anything self-identical?" - the question presupposes what it questions.

### 13.2 The Depth of Structural Fine-Tuning

Consider the chain of dependencies:

1. **Without 3FLL:** No distinguishability, no structure, no possibility of determinate states
2. **Without quantum structure:** No stable atoms, no chemistry, no complex matter
3. **Without fine-tuned constants:** No stars, no planets, no life

Level 1 (constants) gets attention because the numbers are striking - α ≈ 1/137, Λ ≈ 10⁻¹²² in Planck units. These numbers seem arbitrary and their values seem miraculous.

But Level 2 (structure) is more fundamental. You cannot tune constants if the framework does not support stable physics at all. The question "what if α were different?" presupposes that quantum mechanics holds - otherwise α has no meaning.

Quantum fine-tuning is the deepest level of contingency we can articulate - deeper than cosmic fine-tuning, because it concerns the framework within which cosmic parameters are defined.

### 13.3 The Perturbation Argument Revisited

Section 9 showed that perturbations to quantum structure destroy physics:

| Perturbation | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Remove complex numbers | No interference; compositional inconsistency |
| Alter unitarity | Norms blow up or decay |
| Change Born exponent | No valid probability measure |
| Use quaternions | Lose tomographic locality |
| Use reals | Effectively classical |
| Perturb linearity | Superluminal signaling |
| Alter commutation | Pathological spectra |
| Remove completeness | No well-defined dynamics |

This is not parameter sensitivity within a framework. This is framework sensitivity - the mathematical structure itself cannot be perturbed without destroying physics entirely.

Compare to constant fine-tuning: if α changes by 10%, atoms become unstable. If the structure of quantum mechanics changes at all, there is no framework in which "atoms" is even a concept.

### 13.4 Why This Matters

Fine-tuning is often framed as a puzzle requiring explanation. Common responses include:

- **Multiverse:** Many universes exist with different values; we observe habitable ones (selection effect)
- **Design:** An intelligent agent chose the values
- **Brute fact:** The values just are what they are
- **Deeper theory:** Some future theory will derive the values

LRT does not resolve this puzzle. But it clarifies what the puzzle is.

The question is not just: why these constants?
The question is: why this structure?

LRT shows that quantum structure is required for stable physics. It does not explain why stable physics exists. But it situates the question at the right level. LRT doesn't answer the "why" but sharpens it: the core question is why a universe with stable quantum structure exists at all.

### 13.5 Structural Fine-Tuning and Selection

The relationship between structural fine-tuning and selection deserves careful statement.

**Selection claim:** Among the structures in IIS that can interface with Boolean actuality, only quantum mechanics produces stable physics capable of supporting observers.

**What this explains:** Why we observe quantum structure. Observers can only exist in quantum universes; therefore, observers observe quantum structure.

**What this does not explain:** Why any such structure exists at all. Why IIS contains quantum structure among its possibilities. Why there are observers rather than none.

The selection argument has the form of the Weak Anthropic Principle. It is not an explanation in the sense of deriving quantum mechanics from more fundamental principles. It is a constraint on what we can observe, given that we observe.

### 13.6 Comparison to Cosmic Fine-Tuning

| Feature | Cosmic Fine-Tuning | Structural Fine-Tuning |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| What varies | Parameter values | Mathematical framework |
| Range of possibilities | Continuous parameter space | Distinct frameworks (classical, quantum, super-quantum GPTs, etc.) |
| Selection criterion | Habitable values | Stable physics |
| Logical priority | Assumes framework | Framework itself at stake |

Structural fine-tuning is logically prior: you need a framework before parameters can be defined. If quantum structure is not fine-tuned, there is no context for discussing whether α = 1/137 is fine-tuned.

### 13.7 Open Questions About Fine-Tuning

LRT situates fine-tuning without explaining it away. Several questions remain:

1. **Is structural fine-tuning contingent or necessary?** Could there be a deeper principle from which quantum structure follows? Or is it brute fact at the structural level?

2. **What is the space of alternative structures?** We know classical probability and various generalized probabilistic theories exist. What is the full space of possibilities in IIS?

3. **Does the multiverse extend to structures?** If multiple parameter values exist (multiverse), do multiple structures also exist? What would a "structure multiverse" mean?

4. **Can fine-tuning be explained by anthropic selection?** Selection explains observation but not existence. Why does IIS contain structures that produce observers?

LRT frames these questions clearly without claiming to answer them. The framework shows where the mystery lies; it does not dissolve the mystery.

### 13.8 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Fine-tuning operates at three levels: constants, structure, and logic
- Structural fine-tuning is deeper than cosmic fine-tuning
- Quantum structure cannot be perturbed without destroying physics
- Selection explains observation but not existence
- LRT situates the fine-tuning puzzle without resolving it

The next section examines how LRT grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" program - showing that the bit (fundamental distinction) derives from 3FLL, and quantum mechanics is what bit-structure looks like at the interface with actuality.

---

## 14. Wheeler's "It from Bit" Grounded

John Archibald Wheeler proposed that physical reality ("it") emerges from informational yes/no questions ("bit"). This was visionary but programmatic - Wheeler sketched a direction without completing the foundational work. LRT provides the grounding Wheeler lacked.

### 14.1 Wheeler's Vision

Wheeler wrote: "Every it - every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself - derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely... from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits" (Wheeler, 1990).

This statement contains several claims:
- Physical entities derive from information
- Information consists of yes/no questions
- The binary structure is fundamental
- Even spacetime emerges from bits

Wheeler never fully developed the metaphysics. What IS a bit, fundamentally? Where do bits come from? Why do bits have the structure they do? How do bits become particles?

### 14.2 LRT's Grounding

LRT answers Wheeler's implicit questions:

**What is a bit?** The minimal unit of distinguishability, constituted by 3FLL. A bit is the simplest distinction: A vs not-A.

**Where do bits come from?** Bits do not "come from" anywhere - they are the fundamental structure that 3FLL establish. Without identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle, there are no distinctions. With them, the bit is the minimal distinction.

**Why binary?** Binary structure reflects Excluded Middle applied at the level of actuality: every actual proposition is either true or false. The binary structure is not a choice; it is constitutive of what actuality means.

**How do bits become particles?** Through the interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. Possibilities in IIS become actual when 3FLL are enforced. Particles are patterns of actualized bits structured by the quantum interface and field modes.

### 14.3 "Bit from Fit"

We extend Wheeler's slogan: **It from bit, bit from fit.**

- **It from bit:** Physical reality emerges from information - from yes/no questions, from distinctions, from bits.
- **Bit from fit:** The bit (fundamental distinction) emerges from the fit between IIS and Boolean actuality.

The "fit" captures several aspects:

**Precision:** The interface between IIS and Boolean actuality requires exact quantum structure. Not approximately quantum - exactly quantum.

**Selection:** Quantum mechanics fits in the sense that it produces stable physics. Classical structure does not fit - it satisfies interface constraints but produces no stable matter. Other structures fail the constraints entirely.

**Relationship:** The bit is not free-floating. It is the elementary unit of the IIS-actuality interface. Bits are how IIS possibilities become actual facts.

### 14.4 The Conversion Factor

If bits are fundamental and physics emerges from them, there must be a conversion between informational and physical quantities.

ℏ (Planck's constant) is the natural candidate:

$$\text{Action} = \hbar \times \text{Complexity}$$

This is the conjecture S = ℏC from Section 8. If correct:

- ℏ is the quantum of action - the minimal amount of physical change
- ℏ is also the conversion factor from bits to action
- One bit of logical distinction corresponds to ℏ of physical action

S = ℏC is not required for LRT's core logical claims; it is a proposed quantitative bridge between bit-structure and physical action. This identification is conjectural but supported by:

**The Planck scale:** At lengths ~ ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³), the bit-structure of distinguishability becomes directly relevant. The Planck scale is where logical granularity meets physical granularity.

**The Bekenstein bound:** Maximum entropy ~ area in Planck units. In LRT terms: maximum distinguishability is finite per region, with Planck area as the natural unit.

**Black hole entropy:** S = A/4ℓ²_P. The information content of a black hole is its horizon area in Planck units - suggesting one bit per Planck area.

### 14.5 The Classical Emergence

The classical world appears continuous because:

1. Classical phenomena involve many bits
2. The bit structure averages out at macroscopic scales
3. Continuous approximation works when individual bits are negligible

This parallels thermodynamics. Temperature is a coarse-grained property that emerges from many particle states. Similarly, classical continuity is a coarse-grained property that emerges from many bits.

The "weirdness" of quantum mechanics is the friction between bit-structure and continuous appearance. Phenomena like superposition, interference, and entanglement are what happens when the bit-level structure cannot be ignored.

### 14.6 Wheeler's Questions Answered

Wheeler posed several questions that his program left open:

**"Why the quantum?"** LRT: Because quantum structure is the unique stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality.

**"What is existence?"** LRT: Existence is actuality - the domain where 3FLL are fully enforced, where propositions have genuine Boolean values grounded in being.

**"What is information?"** LRT: Information is distinguishability structure, constituted by 3FLL. The bit is the minimal unit of this structure.

**"How does the observer participate?"** LRT: The observer does not create reality but interfaces with it. Measurement is the category transition from IIS to actuality - not observation creating facts, but observation registering which IIS configuration actualized.

### 14.7 What Wheeler Got Right

Wheeler's intuitions align remarkably with LRT:

- Information is more fundamental than matter (LRT: bits derive from 3FLL; particles derive from bits)
- Yes/no questions are basic (LRT: the bit is the minimal logical structure)
- Physics and information are unified (LRT: quantum mechanics is the interface structure)
- Existence involves participation (LRT: measurement is category transition)

Wheeler lacked the philosophical foundation. He had the vision but not the grounding. LRT provides what Wheeler sketched.

### 14.8 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- Wheeler's "it from bit" is grounded by LRT
- The bit derives from 3FLL as the minimal unit of distinguishability
- "Bit from fit" extends the slogan to include the interface selection
- ℏ may be the conversion factor between bits and action
- Classical physics emerges from coarse-graining over many bits
- Wheeler's key intuitions align with LRT's framework

The next section examines how LRT relates to and completes other foundational programs in quantum mechanics.

---

## 15. Completing Related Programs

LRT does not stand alone. It connects to, grounds, or completes several existing programs in foundations of physics. This section maps these relationships.

### 15.1 Interpretations Grounded

The major interpretations of quantum mechanics each capture something important. LRT shows what each captures and what it lacks.

**Copenhagen:** Copenhagen refused to say what the wave function "really is" - it is a tool for predicting outcomes, no more. Bohr emphasized complementarity and the role of measurement but avoided ontological commitment.

LRT provides what Copenhagen refused: the wave function is IIS structure, real but not actual until measurement. Copenhagen's operational success reflects the correctness of the IIS/actuality interface. Copenhagen's silence on ontology reflects legitimate caution about conflating the domains.

**QBism:** QBism (Quantum Bayesianism; Fuchs and Schack, 2013) says quantum states are agent's beliefs about future experiences. States are not objective features of the world but subjective degrees of belief.

LRT grounds what those beliefs track. Beliefs are not arbitrary; they correspond to genuine features of IIS. The wave function represents real structure - the agent's beliefs are about something. QBism correctly identifies the subjective element in measurement but underestimates the objective element in IIS.

**Relational QM:** Rovelli's relational interpretation (Rovelli, 1996) says properties are relative to interactions. There is no absolute fact about which outcome occurred; facts are relative to observers.

LRT explains why: context determines which partition of IIS interfaces with actuality. Different interactions probe different aspects of IIS structure. The relational character is real but not because facts are subjective - because IIS structure is context-sensitive in its actualization.

**Many-Worlds:** Everett's interpretation (Everett, 1957) preserves wave function realism and removes collapse. All branches are equally real.

LRT preserves MWI's insights (wave function realism, no collapse mechanism) while restoring single actuality. The "branches" exist as possibilities in IIS; one actualizes. MWI correctly identified the reality of quantum states but conflated IIS with actuality.

**Bohmian Mechanics:** Pilot-wave theory (Bohm, 1952) adds definite particle positions to the wave function. Particles follow deterministic trajectories guided by the wave.

LRT shares Bohmian mechanics' commitment to definite outcomes but locates them differently. For LRT, definiteness emerges at the IIS/actuality interface, not from hidden variables. Bohm correctly intuited that something definite underlies quantum phenomena but located it in particle positions rather than in the structure of actuality itself.

### 15.2 Programs Completed

**Reconstruction theorems:** Hardy, Chiribella, and others have derived quantum structure from operational axioms (tomographic locality, continuous reversibility, etc.). These theorems show quantum mechanics is uniquely characterized by certain properties.

LRT grounds these axioms. The reconstruction axioms are features required for stable interface between IIS and Boolean actuality. Continuous reversibility preserves information in IIS. Local tomography ensures consistency across subsystems. The theorems do not derive quantum mechanics from logic alone, but they show that quantum structure is uniquely determined once reasonable interface requirements are imposed.

**Decoherence:** The decoherence program explains how interference terms vanish through environmental interaction. It shows why macroscopic superpositions are not observed.

LRT explains what decoherence accomplishes: the transfer of phase information to the environment, enforcing local Boolean structure at the system level. Decoherence does not solve the measurement problem (it does not explain why one outcome occurs) but it explains why the problem does not manifest macroscopically.

**Wheeler's program:** As detailed in Section 14, LRT grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" by showing that the bit derives from 3FLL and quantum mechanics is the interface structure.

**Zeilinger's foundational principle:** Zeilinger proposed that an elementary system carries exactly one bit of information. This is a foundational principle for quantum mechanics.

LRT explains why: the bit is the fundamental unit of distinguishability. Elementary systems are minimal carriers because they instantiate minimal distinction. Zeilinger's principle is not arbitrary; it reflects the logical constitution of physical information.

### 15.3 Principles Connected

LRT connects to several principles from physics and information theory:

**Landauer's principle:** Erasing one bit of information costs at least kT ln 2 of energy (Landauer, 1961). Information erasure has thermodynamic cost.

In LRT terms: destroying a distinction has thermodynamic cost because distinctions are ontologically real. Erasure is not merely subjective loss of knowledge; it is objective reduction of structure.

**Holographic principle:** The entropy of a region is bounded by its surface area in Planck units, not its volume. Information is holographic.

In LRT terms: distinguishability has a spatial density limit. There is a maximum number of bits per Planck area. The holographic bound reflects the finite granularity of distinguishability.

**Bekenstein bound:** A region of space has finite information capacity proportional to its size and energy (Bekenstein, 1973).

In LRT terms: actuality can only support finite distinguishability in finite regions. The bound is not merely thermodynamic but logical - finite regions cannot instantiate infinite distinction.

### 15.4 Mathematical Universe Refined

Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH; Tegmark, 2008) claims that reality IS mathematical structure. All consistent mathematical structures exist; we inhabit one.

LRT refines this:

- Not all mathematical structures in IIS are actualized
- 3FLL + stability select which structures produce physics
- The relationship is constitutive (3FLL generate structure) not compositional (structure = reality)

LRT is compatible with the spirit of MUH - mathematics is ontologically fundamental - while being more specific about the selection mechanism. Not every consistent structure exists as physical reality; only the stability-selected structures do.

### 15.5 Information-Theoretic Physics

The information-theoretic approach to physics (Lloyd, Vedral, etc.) treats information as physically fundamental. LRT provides the philosophical foundation:

- Information IS distinguishability, constituted by 3FLL
- Physics emerges from information structure
- The bit is the fundamental unit
- Quantum mechanics is the interface between information and actuality

The information-theoretic program has the right intuition but often lacks philosophical grounding. LRT supplies that grounding.

### 15.6 What LRT Adds to Each Program

| Program | What They Have | What LRT Adds |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Copenhagen | Operational accuracy | Ontological interpretation |
| QBism | Subjective element | Objective grounding |
| Relational QM | Context-sensitivity | IIS structure |
| Many-Worlds | Wave function realism | Single actuality |
| Bohmian | Definite outcomes | Interface mechanism |
| Reconstruction | Axiom derivation | Axiom grounding |
| Decoherence | Interference suppression | Measurement interpretation |
| Wheeler | "It from bit" vision | Logical foundation |
| Zeilinger | Elementary = 1 bit | Constitutional explanation |
| Landauer | Erasure cost | Ontological basis |
| Holography | Area bounds | Distinguishability limit |
| Tegmark | Mathematical existence | Selection via stability and 3FLL-constituted distinguishability |

### 15.7 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- LRT grounds the major interpretations by providing what each lacks
- Reconstruction theorems identify interface requirements that LRT explains
- Information-theoretic principles connect to LRT's constitutional framework
- The Mathematical Universe Hypothesis is refined by selection considerations
- LRT does not replace these programs but completes them

This concludes Part II: Physical Interpretation. Part III develops the mathematical formalization.

## Part III: Mathematical Structure

## 16. LRT Axioms

Parts I and II established the philosophical foundations and physical interpretation. This section states the formal axioms from which the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is derived. The axiom structure is minimal: we state what must be assumed, distinguish different tiers of assumption, and identify what is derived versus what is postulated.

### 16.1 Primitive Terms

We begin with undefined primitive terms. These are not derived but taken as foundational.

**Definition 16.1 (Three Fundamental Logical Laws).** The 3FLL are:
- **Identity (I):** ∀x: x = x
- **Non-Contradiction (NC):** ∀x, P: ¬(P(x) ∧ ¬P(x))
- **Excluded Middle (EM):** ∀x, P: P(x) ∨ ¬P(x)

**Definition 16.2 (Distinguishability).** A binary relation D on a set S, primitive but constrained by 3FLL: D(x,y) is definable only if x, y satisfy 3FLL. D takes values in [0,1], where D(x,y) = 0 means identical and D(x,y) = 1 means perfectly distinguishable. The inner-product structure of D will be derived in Section 17.

**Definition 16.3 (Infinite Information Space).** The maximal collection IIS of states closed under distinguishability:

$$\mathcal{I} = \{s : D \text{ is defined on } s \times \mathcal{I}\}$$

*Remark:* The maximality of IIS ensures it is infinite-dimensional. This will be relevant for applying Gleason's theorem, which requires dimension ≥ 3.

**Definition 16.4 (Boolean Structure).** A set B equipped with operations {∧, ∨, ¬} satisfying the Boolean algebra axioms, with carrier set {0,1}.

**Definition 16.5 (Context).** A partition C of (a subspace of) IIS into mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive alternatives.

### 16.2 The Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Constitution).** 3FLL constitute distinguishability. For any x, y ∈ IIS:

$$D(x,y) \text{ is well-defined} \iff x, y \text{ satisfy I, NC, EM}$$

*This axiom asserts that distinguishability is not primitive but is constituted by logical structure. Without 3FLL, there is no basis for one state to differ from another.*

---

**Axiom 2 (Pairwise Structure).** Distinguishability is a binary relation. For any assessment of distinguishability, exactly two states are compared:

$$D: \mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{I} \rightarrow [0,1]$$

where D(x,y) = 0 means identical, D(x,y) = 1 means perfectly distinguishable.

*This axiom captures that distinguishability is relational - it compares pairs. This pairwise character grounds the quadratic structure of quantum mechanics.*

---

**Axiom 3 (Physical Constraints on IIS).** The space IIS admits:

**(a) Continuous transformations** (Hardy, 2001; Masanes & Müller, 2011)**:** For any two states s₁, s₂ with D(s₁,s₂) < 1, there exists a continuous path of states connecting them.

**(b) Reversible transformations** (Hardy, 2001, Axiom 4)**:** For any transformation T on IIS, there exists T⁻¹ such that T⁻¹T = TT⁻¹ = id.

**(c) Local tomography** (Chiribella et al., 2011; Masanes & Müller, 2011)**:** For any composite system with subsystems A and B, the state of the whole is uniquely determined by the statistics of local measurements on A and B separately.

*Remark on 3(c):* This axiom is crucial for determining the number field. It asserts that the distinguishability of a composite system is determined by local measurements on its parts. This rules out holistic theories where the whole cannot be reconstructed from the parts.

*Justification:* These constraints are not arbitrary. Continuity is required for dynamics to be well-defined. Reversibility is required for information preservation in IIS (non-reversible dynamics would lose distinguishability). Local tomography is required for physics to be compositional - for us to learn about wholes by studying parts. These are standard axioms in reconstruction programs; LRT provides philosophical grounding for them.

---

**Axiom 4 (Boolean Actuality).** There exists a map Φ from IIS to Boolean outcomes:

$$\Phi_C: \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{|C|}$$

for each context C, satisfying:
- (a) **Totality:** Φ_C is defined for all s ∈ IIS (from EM)
- (b) **Single-valuedness:** For each s and C, Φ_C(s) is unique (from NC)
- (c) **Exclusivity:** Exactly one element of C receives value 1 (from EM + NC)

*This axiom asserts that actuality is Boolean - determinate, non-contradictory, complete. It does not yet specify HOW Φ assigns values, only that it does so consistently with 3FLL.*

*Clarification:* Φ_C is not assumed to exist prior to measurement; it represents the actualization map at the interface. It does not imply pre-existing definite values in IIS - there is no hidden-variable assumption here. The map describes what happens when IIS structure interfaces with Boolean actuality, not what was already determined.

---

**Axiom 5 (Non-Contextual Measure).** The interface map Φ induces a probability measure μ on outcomes satisfying:

**(a) Non-negativity:** μ(s, c) ≥ 0 for all states s and outcomes c

**(b) Normalization:** For any context C = {c₁, ..., cₙ}, we have Σᵢ μ(s, cᵢ) = 1

**(c) Distinguishability-respecting:** If D(s,s') = 0, then μ(s,c) = μ(s',c) for all c

**(d) Non-contextuality of measure:** The measure assigned to a subspace H is independent of the orthogonal complement H⊥ used to complete the context. That is, if H appears in two different contexts C and C', then μ(s, H) is the same in both.

*Remark on 5(d):* This is the crucial condition for Gleason's theorem. It asserts that the probability of an outcome depends only on the state and the outcome, not on what other outcomes were possible. Without this, Gleason's theorem does not apply.

*This axiom asserts that the interface has a probability measure with specific properties. It does NOT assert that this measure is |ψ|². That will be derived.*

### 16.3 Axiom Tier Classification

Not all axioms have the same status. We classify them:

| Axiom | Tier | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 (Constitution) | Foundational | LRT-specific thesis |
| 2 (Pairwise) | Foundational | Structural requirement |
| 3a (Continuity) | Physical | Required for dynamics |
| 3b (Reversibility) | Physical | Required for information preservation |
| 3c (Local Tomography) | Physical | Required for compositional physics |
| 4 (Boolean Actuality) | Foundational | From 3FLL enforcement |
| 5 (Non-Contextual Measure) | Structural | Interface property |

**Tier 1 (LRT-specific):** Axioms 1 and 2 are the core LRT claims - that 3FLL constitute distinguishability and that distinguishability is pairwise.

**Tier 2 (Physical):** Axiom 3 states physical requirements. These are not derived from logic alone but are required for stable, informative physics.

**Tier 3 (Structural):** Axioms 4 and 5 describe the interface structure. They follow from 3FLL enforcement (Axiom 4) or state interface properties (Axiom 5).

### 16.4 What Is Derived, Not Axiomatized

From these five axioms, we derive:

- **Hilbert space structure** (Section 17)
- **Complex numbers** as the field (Section 17)
- **Born rule** (Section 18)
- **Global parsimony** (below)

These are theorems, not axioms. The derivations use established results (Masanes-Müller, Gleason) applied to the LRT axiom structure.

### 16.5 Global Parsimony Derived

Section 7.6 introduced parsimony as derived from constitution and grounding. Here we state it formally, drawing on established work in truthmaker theory (Armstrong, 2004; Mulligan et al., 1984) and grounding (Schaffer, 2009; Fine, 2012).

**Constitutive Closure Principle (CCP).** If domain D is constituted by package P_const, then D contains exactly the structure generated by P_const. Nothing whose existence requires an additional source lies in D. (This follows the constitutive-rule framework of Sider, 2011; Tahko, 2015.)

**Truthmaker Requirement (TM).** If a proposition P in the fundamental physical description has Boolean value v ∈ {0,1}, then some ground G ∈ (3FLL + s₀) determines P = v. (This adapts Armstrong's truthmaker maximalism to the LRT context.)

**Definition 16.6 (Grounded Proposition).** P is grounded iff its truth-value is determined by: (1) logical necessity from 3FLL, (2) logical entailment from grounded propositions, (3) initial condition s₀, or (4) propagation through dynamical laws.

**Definition 16.7 (Surplus Proposition).** P is surplus iff its truth-value is determined by none of sources (1)-(4).

**Lemma 16.8.** If P is surplus, then P has no genuine Boolean value.

*Proof.* Immediate from TM. ∎

**Lemma 16.9.** No surplus proposition lies in actuality.

*Proof.* Suppose P ∈ A. Then P must possess a grounded Boolean value by enforcement. But surplus propositions lack such grounds (Lemma 16.8). Contradiction. ∎

**Theorem 16.10 (Global Parsimony).** Actuality contains exactly the grounded propositions and nothing more. Equivalently, actuality is the minimal Boolean structure sufficient for global enforcement of 3FLL relative to the constitutive package (3FLL + s₀).

*Proof.*

1. Actuality is constituted by (3FLL + s₀). [Core claim of LRT]
2. By CCP, actuality contains exactly what this package generates.
3. The generative sources for propositions in this package are: (a) logical structure from 3FLL, (b) initial structure from s₀, (c) grounded entailments from (a)-(b), (d) propagation via dynamics. These correspond precisely to grounding sources (1)-(4).
4. Thus (3FLL + s₀) generates exactly the grounded propositions.
5. Surplus propositions have no grounds and cannot be enforced (Lemma 16.8).
6. Surplus propositions therefore cannot be actual (Lemma 16.9).
7. Conversely, all grounded propositions are generated by (3FLL + s₀).
8. Therefore A consists exactly of grounded propositions, each with exactly one Boolean value. ∎

**Corollary 16.11.** Parsimony is a theorem, not an axiom. It requires no independent assumption.

### 16.6 Revised Axiom Structure

With parsimony derived, the minimal axiom base is:

| # | Element | Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| A1 | 3FLL constitute distinguishability | Axiom |
| A2 | Distinguishability is pairwise | Axiom |
| A3 | Physical constraints (continuity, reversibility, local tomography) | Axiom |
| A4 | Boolean actuality (3FLL enforcement domain) | Axiom |
| A5 | Non-contextual measure | Axiom |
| D1 | Grounded proposition | Definition |
| P1 | Constitutive Closure (CCP) | Principle (from A1) |
| P2 | Truthmaker Requirement (TM) | Principle |
| **T1** | **Global Parsimony** | **Theorem** |

### 16.7 What This Section Establishes

We have:

- Stated five formal axioms for LRT
- Classified axioms by tier (foundational, physical, structural)
- Proved Global Parsimony as a theorem
- Identified what is derived versus assumed

The next section derives Hilbert space structure from these axioms.

---

## 17. Deriving Hilbert Space Structure

This section shows that Hilbert space structure follows from the LRT axioms via established reconstruction theorems. The derivation is not novel - it leverages rigorous results from quantum foundations - but its grounding in LRT is.

### 17.1 The Derivation Strategy

The strategy is:

1. Show that LRT axioms satisfy the premises of the Masanes-Müller theorem
2. Apply Masanes-Müller to conclude that IIS has complex Hilbert space structure
3. Verify that the derived structure has the required properties

This is a derivation within LRT, not a derivation of LRT. The axioms are assumed; the structure follows.

### 17.2 Inner Product Structure

**Theorem 17.1 (Inner Product Structure).** If IIS satisfies Axioms 1-5, then the distinguishability relation D induces an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ on IIS.

*Proof:*

Axiom 2 establishes that D is pairwise - a function of two states.

Axiom 3(a) establishes continuity: the state space is connected.

Axiom 3(b) establishes reversibility: transformations are invertible.

Axiom 3(c) establishes local tomography: composites are determined by parts.

Axiom 5 provides the probabilistic structure: IIS is a convex operational state space with a non-contextual probability measure on measurement outcomes. This is essential for the reconstruction theorem to apply.

By the Masanes-Müller reconstruction theorem (Masanes & Müller, 2011), any state space satisfying:
1. Continuous reversible dynamics
2. Local tomography
3. Existence of entangled states (non-trivial composites)

admits a unique representation as a complex Hilbert space with standard quantum operations.

Conditions 1 and 2 are Axioms 3(a-c). Condition 3 follows from the richness of IIS - since IIS contains all distinguishable configurations (Definition 16.3), it contains composite states that are not product states.

Therefore IIS admits complex inner product structure. ∎

### 17.3 Why Complex Numbers

**Theorem 17.2 (Complex Numbers).** The field over which the inner product is defined is ℂ (complex numbers), not ℝ (reals) or ℍ (quaternions).

*Proof:*

This follows from Axiom 3(c) (Local Tomography) via Masanes & Müller (2011).

Consider the alternatives:

**Real quantum mechanics (ℝ):** Satisfies continuity and reversibility but has impoverished interference structure. More critically, real QM does not satisfy local tomography in general - there exist real quantum states of composite systems that cannot be distinguished by local measurements alone.

**Quaternionic quantum mechanics (ℍ):** Satisfies continuity and reversibility but violates local tomography. In quaternionic QM, the joint state of a composite system contains more information than can be extracted from local measurements on the parts. Additionally, quaternionic theories fail to reproduce standard tensor-product composition rules except in restricted cases (Solér, 1995; Caves et al., 2004).

**Complex quantum mechanics (ℂ):** Uniquely satisfies all three conditions. Complex numbers provide exactly the right structure for interference (via phases) while maintaining local tomography.

Therefore, Axiom 3(c) forces the field to be ℂ. ∎

*Experimental confirmation:* Recent experiments (Renou et al., 2021) have confirmed that quantum mechanics requires complex numbers - real-valued quantum theories make different predictions that have been ruled out.

### 17.4 Hilbert Space

**Theorem 17.3 (Hilbert Space).** IIS, equipped with the inner product from Theorem 17.1, is a complex Hilbert space ℋ.

*Proof:*

The inner product from Theorem 17.1 satisfies:
- Conjugate symmetry: ⟨x|y⟩ = ⟨y|x⟩*
- Linearity in second argument: ⟨x|αy + βz⟩ = α⟨x|y⟩ + β⟨x|z⟩
- Positive definiteness: ⟨x|x⟩ ≥ 0, with equality iff x = 0

Completeness (every Cauchy sequence converges) follows from the maximality of IIS (Definition 16.3): IIS includes limit points of all Cauchy sequences generated by distinguishability relations. Any limit point of a sequence of distinguishable states is itself distinguishable from other states (since distinguishability is continuous in the induced topology), hence lies in IIS. This aligns with standard reconstructions where the operational state space is taken to be norm-closed. ∎

### 17.5 Dimension

**Corollary 17.4 (Dimension).** dim(ℋ) ≥ 3 in physically relevant subsystems, satisfying the requirement for Gleason's theorem.

*Proof:*

IIS is maximal (Definition 16.3) and contains composite systems with entanglement (proof of Theorem 17.1). Any such space has dimension at least 4 (two qubits). More generally, IIS is infinite-dimensional, containing arbitrarily complex distinguishable configurations. ∎

*Remark:* Gleason's theorem fails for dim = 2 (a single qubit admits non-Born probability measures). However, this is not a limitation for LRT. The physical universe is never a single isolated qubit - any physically relevant subsystem is embedded in IIS and participates in composite systems of dimension ≥ 4. The dim ≥ 3 requirement is satisfied for any subsystem whose measurement statistics must be consistent with the larger whole. Individual qubits inherit the Born rule from their embedding in higher-dimensional composites.

### 17.6 The Distinguishability Metric

With Hilbert space structure established, we can express distinguishability precisely.

**Definition 17.5 (Distinguishability Distance).** For states x, y ∈ IIS:

$$d(x,y) = \sqrt{1 - |\langle x|y\rangle|^2}$$

This is the **Fubini-Study metric** on projective Hilbert space (Bengtsson & Życzkowski, 2006).

**Properties:**
- d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y (up to phase)
- d(x,y) = 1 iff x ⊥ y (perfectly distinguishable)
- Triangle inequality holds

**Proposition 17.6.** The distinguishability metric is the natural metric on IIS induced by Axiom 2.

*Proof:* Axiom 2 defines D: IIS × IIS → [0,1]. Given Hilbert space structure (Theorem 17.3), the inner product ⟨x|y⟩ measures overlap. The Fubini-Study metric converts this to a distance satisfying metric axioms. ∎

### 17.7 Symmetries of IIS

**Definition 17.7 (IIS Symmetry).** A symmetry of IIS is a bijection S: IIS → IIS preserving distinguishability:

$$D(Sx, Sy) = D(x, y) \quad \forall x, y$$

**Theorem 17.8 (Wigner).** Every symmetry of IIS is implemented by either:
- A unitary operator U: ⟨Ux|Uy⟩ = ⟨x|y⟩, or
- An antiunitary operator A: ⟨Ax|Ay⟩ = ⟨x|y⟩*

*Proof:* Standard Wigner theorem. Distinguishability-preserving maps on projective Hilbert space are (anti)unitary. ∎

**Corollary 17.9.** The symmetry group of IIS is:

$$\text{Sym}(\mathcal{I}) = U(\mathcal{H}) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$$

where U(ℋ) is the unitary group and ℤ₂ is time-reversal (complex conjugation).

### 17.8 The Derivation Chain (Summary)

```
3FLL (Axiom 1)
    ↓ constitutes
Distinguishability (Definition 16.2, Axiom 2)
    ↓ + physical constraints (Axiom 3)
Complex Hilbert Space (Theorems 17.1-17.3, via Masanes-Müller)
```

### 17.9 What This Section Establishes

We have shown:

- IIS has inner product structure (from pairwise distinguishability + physical constraints)
- The field must be complex (from local tomography)
- IIS is a complete Hilbert space (from maximality)
- Dimension ≥ 3 (from compositional richness)
- Symmetries are (anti)unitary (Wigner's theorem)

The derivation is conditional on Axiom 3 (physical constraints). These constraints are not derived from 3FLL alone but are required for stable, compositional physics. The derivation shows: given 3FLL + physical requirements, Hilbert space follows.

The next section derives the Born rule from this Hilbert space structure.
