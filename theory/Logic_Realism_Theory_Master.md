## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) holds that the three fundamental laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - are not cognitive conventions or linguistic rules but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality. This paper presents the unified framework: philosophical foundations establishing the ontological status of logical laws; the physical interpretation showing quantum mechanics as the unique stable interface between the Infinite Information Space (IIS) and Boolean actuality; the mathematical formalization deriving Hilbert space structure via reconstruction theorems and the Born rule via Gleason's theorem; empirical grounding through 17+ retrodictions, 20+ testable predictions, and 12 explicit falsifiers; and consilience evidence from seven independent domains converging on identical deep structures. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from logic alone. We claim that quantum structure is uniquely selected by stability requirements - structural fine-tuning at the deepest level. One prediction (complex quantum mechanics required) has already been confirmed experimentally. The framework dissolves foundational puzzles of quantum mechanics, grounds Wheeler's "it from bit" program, and explains the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. It from bit; bit from fit.

## 1. Introduction: The Question

What is the status of the laws of logic?

This question, ancient in origin, admits several answers. The laws of logic - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle - might be cognitive constraints: features of how minds necessarily operate. They might be linguistic conventions: rules we adopt to make communication possible. They might be useful fictions: approximations that work well enough for practical purposes. Or they might be something else entirely.

This paper defends a different view: **the three fundamental laws of logic are not merely rules of reasoning but ontological constraints constitutive of physical reality itself.**

On this view - Logic Realism Theory (LRT) - the laws of logic do not describe how we think about reality. They describe what reality must be. A world that violated Non-Contradiction would not be a strange world we could visit; it would not be a world at all. The logical laws are not filters we impose on experience but the conditions under which experience - and existence - are possible.

The implications are substantial. If logic is constitutive of reality, then the structure of physics is not arbitrary. The "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" dissolves: mathematics and physics share a common root in logical structure. The puzzles of quantum mechanics - superposition, entanglement, the measurement problem - receive new interpretation. And a deep unity emerges across domains that appear disconnected: physics, information theory, thermodynamics, and computation converge on identical structures because they all study manifestations of the same underlying logical constitution.

### 1.1 The Central Formula

LRT can be expressed formally:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **A** (Actuality) is the realized physical world - what actually exists
- **I** (Infinite Information Space) is the totality of distinguishable states - everything that could be
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of 3FLL over IIS, together with the grounding structure that yields global parsimony (derived in Part III, not assumed)

Actuality equals logical filtering applied to the space of possibilities. This is the core thesis. Note that L is introduced here as 3FLL-enforcement; later sections show that enforcing groundedness forces a globally parsimonious Boolean structure.

### 1.2 What This Paper Does and Does Not Claim

We must be precise about claims from the outset.

**What LRT claims:**
- The three fundamental logical laws are ontological, not merely cognitive or linguistic
- Quantum mechanics is the unique stable interface between possibility (IIS) and actuality (Boolean structure)
- This explains otherwise mysterious features of quantum theory
- Multiple independent domains converge on structures LRT predicts

**What LRT does not claim:**
- That quantum mechanics is logically necessary (it is structurally fine-tuned)
- That all of physics can be derived from logic alone (physical constraints are also required)
- That consciousness or observation is explained (beyond functional role)
- That fine-tuning is explained (we situate it, not explain it away)

The distinction between derivation and fine-tuning is crucial. We do not claim to derive quantum mechanics from pure logic. We claim that quantum mechanics is the unique stable structure that can interface between the rich possibilities of information space and the Boolean requirements of actuality. This is a selection claim, not a derivation claim.

### 1.3 Structure of the Paper

The argument proceeds in six parts:

**Part I (Sections 1-6)** establishes the philosophical foundations: what are the three laws, why think they are ontological, what objections arise, and how does IIS relate to 3FLL.

**Part II (Sections 7-15)** develops the physical interpretation: the interface problem, why quantum structure survives, the Born rule, and how foundational puzzles dissolve.

**Part III (Sections 16-22)** provides the mathematical framework: precise axioms, the derivation chain from 3FLL to Hilbert space to Born rule, and how existing interpretations fit.

**Part IV (Sections 23-30)** examines empirical grounding: retrodictions (what LRT explains), predictions (what LRT implies), and falsifiers (what would refute LRT).

**Part V (Sections 31-37)** presents the consilience argument: how independent domains converge on identical structures, supporting the thesis through unexpected agreement.

**Part VI (Sections 38-41)** synthesizes: honest accounting of what is derived versus assumed, comparison to other frameworks, and conclusions.

The reader may proceed linearly or jump to sections of particular interest. However, the argument is cumulative: later sections presuppose earlier ones.

## 2. The Three Fundamental Logical Laws

Since antiquity, three principles have been considered foundational to reasoning. Aristotle articulated them in Book Gamma of the *Metaphysics*, where he declares the law of non-contradiction "the firmest of all principles" (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1005b). These laws have remained central to logic ever since. We call them the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL).

### 2.1 Law of Identity

**Statement:** Everything is identical to itself.

$$\forall x: x = x$$

This appears trivially true - what else could a thing be but itself? Yet the law does substantial work. It asserts that things have determinate natures. A thing is what it is, not something else. Without identity, there would be no basis for predication: we could not say "A is F" if A were not determinately A.

Identity grounds reference. When we speak of an electron, we speak of *that* electron - the one identical to itself across time and context. Identity makes objects objects.

### 2.2 Law of Non-Contradiction

**Statement:** Nothing can both be and not be in the same respect at the same time.

$$\forall x, P: \neg(P(x) \land \neg P(x))$$

A thing cannot simultaneously have and lack the same property in the same respect. The electron cannot be both spin-up and spin-down *as an actualized measurement outcome*. The cat cannot be both alive and dead *as a determinate fact*.

Aristotle considered this the most certain of all principles - one that cannot coherently be denied, since any denial presupposes it (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1006a). Modern dialetheists challenge this claim, but as we shall see, their formal systems do not describe physical reality.

### 2.3 Law of Excluded Middle

**Statement:** For any proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.

$$\forall x, P: P(x) \lor \neg P(x)$$

There is no middle ground between being and not-being. For actualized measurement outcomes, the electron is either here or not here. The proposition is either true or false. Excluded Middle rules out gaps in truth value.

This law is more contested than the others. Intuitionists reject it for mathematical domains where constructive proof is unavailable. But for actualized physical states - determinate facts about the world - Excluded Middle appears inviolable. (The distinction between indeterminacy in IIS and determinacy in actuality is central to our later treatment of quantum mechanics.)

### 2.4 Historical Context

Aristotle formulated these laws in the fourth century BCE, treating them as axioms of thought and being. The Scholastics elaborated them. Leibniz made them cornerstones of his philosophy. Frege and Russell built modern logic upon them.

In the twentieth century, challenges arose:

- **Intuitionist mathematics** rejected Excluded Middle for non-constructive domains (Brouwer, Heyting)
- **Paraconsistent logics** explored systems tolerating contradiction without explosion (Priest, 2006)
- **Quantum logic** questioned distributivity (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936)
- **Dialetheism** defended the existence of true contradictions (Priest, Beall, and Armour-Garb, 2004)
- **Logical pluralism** argued that multiple logical systems can be equally valid (Beall and Restall, 2006)

These developments show that *alternative formal systems* are possible. They do not show that *physical reality* violates the three laws. LRT distinguishes sharply between formal possibility (what can be symbolically represented) and ontological actuality (what can physically obtain). No paraconsistent logic has produced a physical theory; no dialetheist has exhibited a physical dialetheia.

### 2.5 Why "Fundamental"

We call these three laws "fundamental" for specific reasons:

**Not reducible:** On this framework, none of the three is derived from the others. Each does independent work. Remove any one and the logical structure collapses.

**Not conventional:** We did not choose these laws; we discovered them. Alternative conventions are conceivable but not actualizable.

**Constitutive:** They do not describe an independently existing reality; they constitute what it means for reality to be determinate at all. This is the metaphysical interpretation defended by Tahko (2009).

**Universal:** Every domain of inquiry presupposes them. Physics, biology, economics, history - all assume that their objects are self-identical, non-contradictory, and determinate.

### 2.6 The Scope Question

A crucial question: to what do the three laws apply?

**Cognitive interpretation:** The laws describe how minds must think. We cannot conceive of violations.

**Linguistic interpretation:** The laws are rules of language. Violating them produces nonsense, not falsehood.

**Ontological interpretation:** The laws describe reality itself. Violations are not merely inconceivable or nonsensical but impossible.

LRT defends the ontological interpretation. The laws are not about us - our psychology, our language, our conventions. They are about reality. A contradiction is not merely something we cannot think or say; it is something that cannot be.

This is the thesis we must now defend.

---

## 3. The Central Argument: Inference to Best Explanation

Before presenting the argument for Logic Realism, we must clarify the framework's structure. LRT rests on **two co-primitive foundations**:

1. **The Three Fundamental Logical Laws (3FLL)** - Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle
2. **The Infinite Information Space (IIS)** - The totality of distinguishable states

These are not in a grounding relation where one explains the other. They are mutually constitutive: without 3FLL, IIS would be undifferentiated noise - no state distinguishable from any other. Without IIS, 3FLL would have nothing to structure - laws without a domain. Together they form the minimal ontological base from which the distinction between possibility and actuality can be articulated.

This section establishes that 3FLL are ontologically constitutive (not merely cognitive or linguistic). Section 4 develops IIS as the co-primitive space that 3FLL structure. Section 5 explains how they jointly constitute Boolean actuality.

### 3.1 Observation 1: Universal Compliance

**No physical manifestation, observed or unobserved, violates the three laws of logic.**

This is not merely an empirical generalization from limited data. Every successful physical theory, every measurement, every causal interaction we have documented respects logical structure. No state of affairs has ever been recorded that instantiates a contradiction. The universality is striking.

Consider the history of physics. Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, the Standard Model - all presuppose and respect classical logic at the meta-level. When apparent paradoxes arise (Zeno's paradoxes, the twin paradox, Schrödinger's cat), resolution always preserves logical consistency. The paradox is in our understanding, not in reality.

Consider the attempts to interpret quantum mechanics as violating non-contradiction. Despite the strangeness of superposition, entanglement, and the measurement problem, quantum physics has consistently resisted interpretation as genuinely contradictory. What we find instead are complementarity frameworks, contextual properties, and probabilistic descriptions - all of which preserve logical consistency.

### 3.2 Observation 2: Detection Capacity

**Human representational capacity is sufficient to detect violations of the logical laws were they to occur.**

This observation is crucial for blocking a deflationary explanation. One might claim that we observe no violations simply because our cognitive apparatus is blind to them - that contradictions exist but we cannot recognize them.

Several considerations tell against this deflationary move:

**Syntactic representation.** We can form representations of contradictions. We can write sentences describing violations. We understand what it would mean for something to violate non-contradiction: "This apple is entirely green and entirely not-green at the same instant." Our representational apparatus is sensitive enough that a genuine violation would create detectable anomalies in our physical descriptions.

**Evolutionary pressure.** Contradictions are informational catastrophes. They eliminate inferential gradients. No agent could use contradictions to guide action because contradictions erase the difference between possible futures. If reality contained action-relevant contradictions, organisms that detected them would have survival advantages. Instead, evolution favored organisms that treat apparent contradictions as errors to be resolved - strong evidence that contradictions do not occur in survival-relevant reality.

**Scientific instrumentation.** Our detection capacity extends far beyond unaided cognition. We have instruments sensitive to phenomena our ancestors could not conceive - quantum states, gravitational waves, cosmic background radiation. If logical violations occurred at any scale we can probe, the systematic success of logically-structured physical theories would be inexplicable.

### 3.3 Candidate Explanations

Why do we observe no violations of logical laws in physical reality? Six candidate explanations present themselves:

**Candidate 1: Coincidence.** Perhaps it is mere happenstance that no violations have occurred in the portion of reality we have accessed.

*Assessment:* Implausible given the universality of the observation across all domains, scales, and epochs of physical inquiry. Coincidence becomes untenable as an explanation for exceptionless regularity.

**Candidate 2: Cognitive limitation.** Perhaps violations exist but our minds cannot detect them.

*Assessment:* Strongly disfavored by Observation 2. Our representational capacity is sufficient to form descriptions of violations; our instrumentation extends far beyond unaided cognition. If violations occurred at any scale we can probe, we would notice.

**Candidate 3: Constitutive constraint.** The laws of logic are structural features of reality itself. Nothing actualizes in violation of them because nothing can - logical structure is a precondition for any state of affairs to exist.

*Assessment:* This is the thesis we defend.

**Candidate 4: Analytic truth.** Perhaps "violations of logic" are not impossible states but pseudo-propositions with no sense - logical sentences have no factual content, so violation-talk is literally nonsense. Logic is not about reality's structure but about what counts as coherent language.

*Assessment:* This explanation cannot account for the predictive success of mathematical physics. At minimum, the success of mathematical physics shows that whatever logic captures is not *merely* a linguistic convention, since its structural constraints keep working far beyond the regimes in which original idealizations were introduced. Idealized models (frictionless planes, point particles, infinite populations) yield correct predictions despite ontological falsehood. The structure works independent of the assumptions.

**Candidate 5: Observer selection.** If observation requires logical structure, we would necessarily find ourselves in logically structured regions even if violations exist elsewhere.

*Assessment:* Insufficient. It requires that structured regions instantiate logical laws anyway - relocating rather than eliminating the question. And it does not explain the fine-grained logical alignment we observe across all domains, including those causally disconnected from us.

**Candidate 6: Description/described gap.** This differs from Candidate 4: here, logical sentences *do* have content, but logical structure applies only to descriptions, not to what is described. The world might be illogical even though our representations of it cannot be.

*Assessment:* Explanatorily inadequate. It cannot explain why descriptions continue to work across radically new physical domains, why mathematics predicts phenomena no one designed the mathematics for, or why the world is so comprehensively modelable. Moreover, even the distinction between description and described presupposes identity and non-contradiction.

### 3.4 Inference to the Best Explanation

Candidate 1 fails immediately; Candidate 2 is strongly disfavored. Candidates 4, 5, and 6 fail to explain the predictive success of mathematics, the uniformity of logical structure across disconnected regions, and the asymmetry between description and reality.

Only Candidate 3 remains.

By inference to the best explanation:

> **The laws of logic are constitutive constraints on physical reality.**

This is not to say that reality "obeys" logic as a student obeys a teacher. It is to say that reality *instantiates* logical structure - that determinate, non-contradictory, self-identical existence is what it means to be a physical state of affairs.

### 3.5 The Strength of the Argument

How strong is this inference? Not deductively certain. Inference to best explanation never achieves certainty. But the argument has significant force:

- The explanandum is universal and exceptionless
- Five of six candidates fail on independent grounds
- The remaining candidate is coherent, parsimonious, and explanatorily powerful
- No counterexamples exist despite extensive search

Compare to other inferences to best explanation we accept: the reality of electrons, the age of the universe, the existence of other minds. Logic Realism is at least as well supported as these.

This establishes the first primitive: 3FLL are constitutive. We now turn to the second primitive: the space that 3FLL structure.

---

## 4. The Infinite Information Space (IIS)

Having established that 3FLL are constitutive of physical reality, we now develop the second primitive: the Infinite Information Space. This is not a second, independent ontology but the co-primitive partner to 3FLL - the domain that logical structure structures.

### 4.1 What IIS Is

**Definition:** The Infinite Information Space (IIS) is the totality of in-principle distinguishable states - every possible informational configuration constituted by 3FLL.

Several clarifications are essential:

**IIS is not a Platonic realm.** We do not posit abstract objects floating in a separate domain. IIS is not "somewhere else" - it is the structural space of what can be distinguished.

**IIS is not a set-theoretic construction.** We do not define IIS as a set of possible worlds or a collection of maximal consistent state-descriptions. Such constructions face cardinality paradoxes. IIS is better understood as a structural concept - what 3FLL make possible - than as a completed totality.

**IIS is not merely epistemic.** It does not represent what we do not know about an otherwise determinate reality. IIS contains genuinely indeterminate states - configurations that are distinguishable but not yet resolved into definite actuality.

**The positive characterization:** IIS is the **space of possibility** constituted by logical distinguishability. It is what can be, given that distinction is possible at all. Its "existence" is not the existence of a thing among things, but the existence of a structural condition - the condition under which there can be distinct states at all.

### 4.2 What "Information" Means

The term "information" invites misunderstanding. We must specify what we mean.

**Not Shannon information.** Shannon information is a statistical measure of surprise or entropy, defined relative to probability distributions over messages. IIS is not a communication channel and does not presuppose senders, receivers, or probabilities.

**Not semantic information.** Semantic information concerns meaning - what propositions are about. IIS is more primitive than meaning; it concerns what can be distinguished, not what distinctions mean.

**Not physical information (in the usual sense).** Physical information typically refers to degrees of freedom in a physical system - bits stored in memory, quantum states of particles. But IIS is not itself a physical system; it is the space from which physical systems are actualized.

**What we do mean: distinguishability structure.** "Information" in IIS refers to the structure of possible distinctions. A "state" in IIS is whatever can be distinguished from other states. The "information content" of a region of IIS is the complexity of distinctions it contains.

This usage aligns with a tradition running from Bateson - "information is a difference that makes a difference" (Bateson, 1972) - through Wheeler's "it from bit" (Wheeler, 1990). Information, in this sense, is more fundamental than matter or energy - it is the structure of distinction itself.

### 4.3 The Modal Status of IIS

What kind of thing is IIS? This question deserves careful treatment.

The risk of Pythagoreanism - the view that "structure is substance" or "mathematics is reality" - is real but navigable. We do not claim that IIS is made of mathematics. We claim that IIS is the structural space that 3FLL constitute, and that physical reality is what actualizes within it. The relationship is constitutive, not compositional.

This parallels standard moves in philosophy of modality. Just as possible worlds semantics does not require believing in concrete parallel universes (Lewis, 1986), IIS does not require believing in a separate realm of informational states. It is a framework for articulating what follows from the constitutive role of 3FLL.

### 4.4 Defending Co-Primitiveness

The claim that 3FLL and IIS are co-primitive may seem stipulative - a way of avoiding the hard question of which is more fundamental. We defend it as follows:

**The grounding regress.** If 3FLL ground IIS, what grounds 3FLL? If IIS grounds 3FLL, what grounds IIS? Any grounding chain must terminate somewhere. We propose that 3FLL and IIS terminate together - neither grounds the other because each requires the other to be what it is.

**Mutual constitution is coherent.** Consider the relationship between a metric and a space. The metric defines distances; the space is what has distances. Neither is prior - they are co-constitutive aspects of a single structure. Similarly, 3FLL and IIS are co-constitutive aspects of the structure of distinguishability.

**The magnetic poles analogy.** The north and south poles of a magnet are mutually dependent - you cannot have one without the other. But neither pole causes or temporally precedes the other. They are co-present aspects of a single magnetic structure.

Similarly, 3FLL and IIS do not "start" in sequence. They are co-present aspects of the structure of distinguishability itself. The question "which came first?" is malformed, just as "which came first, the north pole or the south pole?" is malformed.

**The alternative is worse.** If we take 3FLL alone as primitive, we face the question: 3FLL over what domain? If we take IIS alone as primitive, we face the question: what makes its states distinguishable? The co-primitiveness thesis answers both at once.

### 4.5 IIS Is Not Boolean

A crucial point: while 3FLL constitute distinguishability, they do not constrain IIS to be Boolean in structure.

**Boolean** refers to a system where every element has a definite binary value - true/false, 0/1, actual/not-actual.

**IIS contains more than Boolean structure.** It contains:
- Determinate states (fully specified configurations)
- Indeterminate states (distinguishable but not resolved to definite values)
- Superpositions (specific indeterminate states with interference structure)
- Classical mixtures (probabilistic combinations without interference)

This distinction is essential:
- **IIS:** Contains all distinguishable states, including indeterminate ones
- **Actuality:** The domain where 3FLL are fully enforced - Boolean, determinate, non-contradictory

The relationship between IIS and actuality is where quantum mechanics enters. This is developed in Part II.

### 4.6 The Library Analogy

Borges' "The Library of Babel" (1941) imagines a universe consisting of an enormous library containing every possible 410-page book - every true statement, every false statement, every string of gibberish. Most of it is noise. The meaningful books exist but are buried in infinity. Jonathan Basile's digital implementation (https://libraryofbabel.info/) allows exploration of this concept - every possible page of text is addressable and retrievable.

IIS is analogous. It contains every possible informational configuration. Most are not physical. Most do not correspond to anything stable. But everything distinguishable is there.

3FLL is what makes the library navigable. Without it, there are no distinct books - just undifferentiated text. 3FLL constitutes the possibility of one book being different from another.

Actuality is the book we are reading. Why this book? That question points beyond what this section establishes. But we can say what the book is: it is one path through IIS, the one that actualizes under the constraints of 3FLL and the selection of parsimony.

---

## 5. Boolean Actuality

The previous sections established two co-primitives: 3FLL and IIS. This section develops their relationship to actuality - the domain of determinate physical facts.

### 5.1 What Actuality Requires

Actuality is the domain where 3FLL are fully enforced. Any physical state of affairs - any event, measurement outcome, or determinate fact - must satisfy:

**Identity:** The state is what it is; it has determinate properties.

**Non-Contradiction:** The state does not simultaneously have and lack the same property.

**Excluded Middle:** For any well-defined property, the state either has it or does not.

This means actuality is **Boolean** - every proposition about an actual state has a definite truth value. The actual world is a consistent, determinate configuration. There are no unresolved truth values in actuality, no superpositions of facts at the level of actual measurement outcomes. When something is actual, it is determinately so.

### 5.2 The Asymmetry Between IIS and Actuality

Here is the key insight: **3FLL constitute the structure of distinguishability in IIS, and they further constrain what can become actual by enforcing Boolean determinacy.**

IIS is richer than Boolean structure. It contains states that are distinguishable from each other but not yet determinate with respect to specific properties. These are not contradictions - they are genuinely indeterminate configurations that 3FLL permit.

Consider the distinction:

| Domain | Structure | 3FLL Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **IIS** | Contains determinate, indeterminate, superposition, and mixture states | Constituted by 3FLL (distinguishability structure) |
| **Actuality** | Contains only determinate Boolean states | Constrained by 3FLL (full enforcement) |

The asymmetry is crucial. 3FLL do two different jobs:
1. They **constitute** what it means for states to be distinguishable at all (structuring IIS)
2. They **constrain** what can be actual (enforcing Boolean determinacy)

### 5.3 Why Actuality Must Be Boolean

Why cannot actuality contain indeterminate states? The answer lies in what actuality means.

**Actuality is what obtains.** To say that X is actual is to say that X is the case - determinately, not probabilistically, not potentially. Indeterminacy belongs in IIS. Once something is counted as actual, indeterminate truth status would either collapse into contradiction or violate Excluded Middle.

**Causal efficacy requires determinacy.** For causal relations among actual facts, states must be determinately what they are. If actual causes were literally neither one way nor another, causal structure would collapse. Physical laws operate on determinate states to produce determinate consequences.

**Observation confirms determinacy.** Every observation, every measurement, every detection yields a definite result. We never observe "half an electron" or "partially here." We often assign probabilities prior to measurement, but the recorded outcome is always a definite event.

### 5.4 The Interface Problem Emerges

This asymmetry creates a fundamental problem: **how do the rich structures of IIS relate to the Boolean structure of actuality?**

IIS contains more than actuality can accommodate. Superpositions, indeterminate states, interference patterns - these exist as elements of IIS but cannot exist as fully actualized facts in Boolean A. Something must connect these domains.

This is the **interface problem**. It asks: what structure mediates between the non-Boolean possibilities of IIS and the Boolean requirements of actuality?

The answer, developed in Part II, is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is not arbitrary; it is the unique stable structure that can perform this mediation. But before developing this claim, we must address objections to the philosophical foundation.

### 5.5 The Central Formula Revisited

We can now state the thesis formula with greater precision:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$$

Where:
- **I** (IIS) is the space of in-principle distinguishable states, constituted by 3FLL
- **L** (Logical Filtering) is the enforcement of Boolean determinacy on distinguishable states, yielding actuality
- **A** (Actuality) is the Boolean domain where 3FLL are fully satisfied

The filtering operation L is not arbitrary selection. It is the requirement that whatever becomes actual must satisfy full Boolean structure. Part III will show that this requirement, combined with grounding principles, yields global parsimony as a theorem.

The interface between I and A - the structure that mediates non-Boolean possibility and Boolean actuality - is where physical law lives. Part II argues this interface is quantum mechanics.
