## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) posits that physical reality is a subset of representable configurations (R(I)) constrained by the three laws of classical logic (L₃). This paper formalizes the **Minimal Viable Set (MVS)** hypothesis, arguing that measurement is not physical collapse but logical selection. We demonstrate that observed physics represents the L₃-admissible configurations capable of forming stable, non-contradictory records.

Central to our argument is that the Born rule is not an independent postulate but a *discovered constraint*—the unique probability measure consistent with L₃-admissible structure. We prove that L₃ constraints are *ontic* (constitutive of physical tokens) rather than *epistemic* (filters on observation), closing the loophole that would allow Many-Worlds branches to exist unobserved. This framework provides a more parsimonious foundation than the Many-Worlds Interpretation while making equivalent empirical predictions.

## 1. Introduction: From Branching to Filtering

Standard quantum mechanics, particularly the Many-Worlds Interpretation, assumes an additive ontology: every mathematical branch in the wave function is equally real. LRT proposes a **subtractive ontology**. The wave function represents the space of all logically *representable* configurations (R(I)), while physical reality is the result of a filtering process that admits only those states forming determinate, non-contradictory records (L(I)).

This is not a hidden-variable theory. LRT accepts the quantum formalism in its entirety. The interpretive shift concerns what the formalism *describes*: not a branching multiverse, but the structure of L₃-admissible possibility space and the unique probability measure upon it.

### 1.1 The Core Thesis

Physical reality satisfies:

$$A = L(I)$$

where:
- **I** = Information (the space of all distinguishable configurations)
- **R(I)** = Representable configurations (mathematically describable states)
- **L(I)** = Logically admissible configurations (satisfying L₃)
- **A** = Actualized reality

The relationship: L(I) ⊆ R(I) ⊆ I

Quantum mechanics describes R(I). Classical physics describes L(I). The "measurement problem" is the question of how R(I) maps to L(I).

## 2. The Minimal Viable Set (MVS) Hypothesis

### 2.1 Definition

The **Minimal Viable Set** is the L₃-consistent configuration of physical states satisfying:

1. **Determinate Identity (Id):** Every instantiated record is uniquely identifiable. For any record r: r = r.

2. **Joint Admissibility (NC):** For any two records r₁ and r₂ to coexist in the same spacetime region, they must not form a contradiction: ¬(r₁ ∧ ¬r₁).

3. **Completeness (EM):** Every physical proposition about instantiated records has a determinate truth value: P ∨ ¬P.

### 2.2 Clarification: "Minimal" and "Viable"

**Viable** means L₃-consistent. A configuration is viable if and only if it satisfies all three laws without contradiction.

**Minimal** is used in the sense of *sufficient*—the MVS contains exactly what is required to form a complete, consistent record, without ontological redundancy. We do not claim the MVS is unique in a strong mathematical sense; rather, we claim that any L₃-consistent actualization will have MVS structure.

*Note:* Whether L₃ constraints uniquely determine a single history or permit a family of consistent histories is an open question. What LRT asserts is that whatever is actualized must satisfy MVS criteria.

### 2.3 The Anti-Holism Principle

A crucial structural claim underlies the MVS: **parts ground wholes**.

**Lemma (Anti-Holism).** If Determinate Identity holds, then global holism is false: composite systems cannot have properties not grounded in their parts.

**Proof.**

Assume, for contradiction, that global holism is true. Then there exist:
- Two composite systems AB₁ and AB₂
- With identical parts: A₁ = A₂ and B₁ = B₂ (same intrinsic properties)
- But different global properties: P(AB₁) ≠ P(AB₂) for some property P

Now apply Determinate Identity (Id-1): the identity of any configuration must be intrinsic, determined by what the configuration *is*, not by extrinsic facts.

Consider the identity of composite AB₁. What determines it?

**Option 1**: The identity of AB₁ is determined by the identities of A₁ and B₁ (anti-holism).

**Option 2**: The identity of AB₁ depends on something beyond A₁ and B₁, namely the global property P (holism).

If Option 2, then the identity of AB₁ depends on a fact (the value of P) that is not grounded in the parts. But what *is* P grounded in?

- Not in A₁ (by assumption, P is not reducible to A-properties)
- Not in B₁ (by assumption, P is not reducible to B-properties)
- Not in some external context (that would violate Id-1: identity is intrinsic)

Therefore P must be a "brute" global fact—a property the composite has that floats free of any grounding.

But this violates Id in a deeper way: if P is ungrounded, then AB₁'s identity (which depends on P) is itself ungrounded. The composite lacks *determinate* identity because there is no fact of the matter about *why* it has P rather than some other value.

**Conclusion**: Global holism requires ungrounded global properties. Ungrounded properties violate Determinate Identity (identity must be determinate, hence grounded). Therefore, global holism is false. Parts ground wholes. ∎

**Corollary.** If A₁ = A₂ and B₁ = B₂ (parts have same identity), then A₁B₁ = A₂B₂ (composites have same identity).

### 2.4 Implication for MVS

The Anti-Holism Lemma has a crucial consequence: **the L₃ filter operates locally**.

If parts ground wholes, then L₃-admissibility of a composite system is determined by the L₃-admissibility of its parts and their relations. There are no "floating" global facts that could make a configuration inadmissible despite having admissible parts.

This means:
- Measurement outcomes are determined by local record formation
- The MVS is the set of locally L₃-admissible records
- No appeal to global wave function structure is needed

## 3. Measurement as Logical Selection

### 3.1 The Standard Problem

In standard quantum mechanics, a system in superposition |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ yields a definite outcome upon measurement. The transition from superposition to definite state is unexplained by unitary evolution alone. This is the measurement problem.

### 3.2 The LRT Interpretation

LRT *interprets* measurement as **L₃ enforcement**. The superposition describes R(I)—all representable configurations of the system. Measurement is the event where the system must enter the macroscopic record as a determinate state satisfying L(I).

*Note:* This is an interpretation of the measurement transition, not a derivation of the physical mechanism. LRT does not specify *how* the transition occurs (decoherence, collapse, or other dynamics); it specifies *what constraint* the outcome must satisfy (L₃-admissibility). The mechanism remains an open question compatible with multiple physical accounts.

**The Constraint:**

1. System S in superposition interacts with environment E
2. The interaction must resolve into a joint state (S + E) that can persist as a stable record
3. Only L₃-admissible configurations can form stable records
4. The "selection" is interpreted as logical filtering—whatever mechanism produces it must yield L₃-consistent outcomes

### 3.3 The Funnel of Identity

We introduce the metaphor of the **Funnel of Identity**. As a quantum system approaches the macroscopic regime:

- The space of L₃-admissible continuations narrows
- Superpositions that cannot resolve into determinate records are excluded
- The surviving configuration is what we observe

This is not a dynamical process in time but a logical constraint on what configurations can *be* records.

### 3.4 The Born Rule as Discovered Constraint

LRT does not postulate the Born rule. The |ψ|² statistics emerge as the unique probability measure consistent with L₃-admissible structure.

**The derivation chain:**

1. **L₃ → Distinguishability:** The Law of Identity requires determinate, distinguishable states. Any physical theory must permit unambiguous state identification.

2. **Distinguishability → Hilbert Space:** Masanes and Müller (2011) proved that the operational requirements following from distinguishability (local tomography, continuous reversible dynamics, existence of entanglement) uniquely select complex Hilbert space as the state space.

3. **Hilbert Space → Born Rule:** Gleason (1957) proved that the only consistent probability measure on projection operators in Hilbert spaces of dimension ≥ 3 is the Born measure |ψ|².

**Consequence:** Born statistics are not free parameters. They are discovered constraints—as necessary given L₃ as the Pythagorean theorem is given Euclidean axioms.

### 3.5 Vehicle-Weight Invariance

The Born rule derivation can be strengthened by the **vehicle/content distinction** (see Born Rule Paper, Longmire 2025):

**Vehicle**: The physical structure doing the representing (quantum state, measurement apparatus)
**Content**: What is represented (outcome possibilities, measurement alternatives)

**Key insight**: The measure over measurement outcomes is part of the *vehicle*, not the content. It characterizes how the physical situation is objectively poised toward outcomes, not how we choose to describe it.

**Lemma (Record-Robustness).** If macroscopic records are objective and counterfactually stable, then pre-record physical states must have objective modal structure toward record-alternatives.

*Proof sketch*: Records satisfy Id (they are determinately what they are). The transition from pre-record state S to record R either:
- Introduces determinacy ex nihilo (violates grounding requirements)
- Preserves determinacy that was already in S

The latter requires S to have objective dispositions toward outcomes. Vehicle-weight objectivity follows. ∎

**Consequence**: If the measure were merely representational (content), it could vary with decomposition. But then the physical situation would be "70% poised toward outcome A" in one decomposition and "50% poised toward outcome A" in another. The system would fail to be determinately poised toward any distribution—violating Determinate Identity at the vehicle level.

This forces **vehicle-weight invariance**: the measure cannot depend on how we decompose the system. Combined with Gleason's theorem, this uniquely yields the Born rule.

### 3.6 Ontological Interpretation of Probability

What do the |ψ|² weights *mean* in the MVS framework?

**Interpretation:** The amplitude-squared represents the **logical measure** of each potential outcome's compatibility with L₃-admissible continuation. Branches with higher |ψ|² have greater "logical weight"—they are more robustly compatible with the constraints that any actualized record must satisfy.

This is analogous to how, in statistical mechanics, higher-entropy macrostates have greater "statistical weight" because more microstates realize them. Here, higher-amplitude outcomes have greater "logical weight" because they more readily satisfy L₃ constraints in combination with environmental degrees of freedom.

## 4. Ontological Economy: LRT vs. Many-Worlds

### 4.1 The Parsimony Question

Both LRT and MWI accept the quantum formalism without modification. The difference is interpretive:

| Aspect | MWI | LRT |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Ontological commitment | All branches equally real | Only L₃-admissible configurations actualized |
| Wave function status | Complete description of reality | Description of R(I), not L(I) |
| Branching | Physical process | Mathematical structure of possibility space |
| Observers | Exist in all branches | Exist in L₃-consistent records only |

### 4.2 The MWI Position

MWI argues that since unitary evolution never produces collapse, all branches must be real. The appearance of a single outcome is explained by observer-indexing: each observer-branch sees their outcome.

**Strengths:** Mathematical elegance; no collapse postulate.

**Costs:** Infinite ontological redundancy; preferred basis problem; probability interpretation difficulties.

### 4.3 The LRT Position

LRT argues that the quantum formalism describes R(I)—the space of representable configurations—while only L(I) is actualized. The mathematical existence of branches does not entail their physical existence.

**Strengths:** Single-world ontology matching observation; Born rule derived not postulated; clear physicality criterion (L₃-admissibility).

**Costs:** Must explain why L₃ constraints select what they select (answered: logical necessity); must explain apparent wave function "collapse" (answered: L₃ filtering).

### 4.4 Evidential Asymmetry

We observe exactly one outcome per measurement. We have stable, consistent records. We have no empirical evidence for branching.

MWI explains this by observer-indexing: you only see your branch.

LRT explains this directly: only one L₃-consistent configuration exists to observe.

**Methodological principle:** When two theories make identical predictions, prefer the one with smaller ontological commitment. LRT posits one world satisfying L₃. MWI posits uncountably many worlds plus an explanation for why we only see one.

---

## 5. Ontic Booleanity: Closing the Epistemic Loophole

A sophisticated objection to the MVS grants that observed outcomes obey L₃ but suggests this might be *epistemic* rather than *ontic*: perhaps L₃ are filters on *observation*, not constraints on *reality*. Hidden outcome tokens might violate L₃ while never appearing in measurements.

This section proves that such tokens cannot exist. The L₃ are ontic constraints on actual outcome tokens themselves, not merely epistemic filters on what we can observe.

### 5.1 Axioms for Ontic Booleanity

We establish ontic Booleanity from five axioms, each derivable from LRT:

| Axiom | Statement | LRT Source |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| OB1 | Outcome tokens are Boolean-valued | A1 (L₃ constitute distinguishability) |
| OB2 | Effects are {0,1}-valued functions on tokens | Derived from interface structure |
| OB3 | Probabilistic completeness and strict positivity | CBP + state space structure |
| OB4 | Path-connectedness of pure states | A3a (continuity) + A3b (reversibility) |
| OB5 | Logical robustness (continuous transition probabilities) | A3a applied to transition probabilities |

### 5.2 Theorem: Ontic Booleanity

**Theorem.** Under axioms OB1-OB5, every actual outcome token satisfies L₃. No token, even one that never occurs with positive probability, can violate L₃.

**Proof Part I: Positive-Probability Tokens**

**Lemma.** Any token t₀ that occurs with positive probability under some state must be Boolean.

*Proof.* Suppose token t₀ violates L₃ for some effect A. Then A(t₀) ≠ 0 and A(t₀) ≠ 1.

Let ω be any state with ω({t₀}) = p > 0 (exists by OB3).

For effect A:
$$\omega(A) = \sum_{t \in T} A(t) \cdot \omega(\{t\}) \geq A(t_0) \cdot p$$

If t₀ is non-Boolean, then:

*Case 1:* If A(t₀) = 1 and ¬A(t₀) = 1 simultaneously (NC violation):
$$\omega(A) \geq p \quad \text{and} \quad \omega(\neg A) \geq p$$
$$\implies \omega(A) + \omega(\neg A) \geq 2p > 1 \text{ for } p > 1/2$$

This contradicts probability normalization ω(A) + ω(¬A) = 1.

*Case 2:* If A(t₀) ≠ 0 and A(t₀) ≠ 1 (EM violation):
The effect A is not well-defined on t₀, contradicting OB2 (effects are total functions). ∎

**Proof Part II: Hidden Zero-Probability Tokens**

**Lemma.** No token t₀ with ω({t₀}) = 0 for all states ω can violate L₃.

*Proof.* Suppose a hidden token t₀ exists with:
- ω({t₀}) = 0 for all states ω
- t₀ violates L₃ for some effect A

By OB4 (path-connectedness), for any two pure states ω₁, ω₂, there exists a continuous path connecting them.

By OB5 (logical robustness), any extension to include t₀ must maintain continuity.

**Key argument:** By OB3 (strict positivity), pure states have support on actual tokens. If t₀ ∈ T but ω({t₀}) = 0 for all pure ω, then t₀ is not in the support of any state.

But the token space is *defined* by what states can distinguish. A token outside all state supports is not a token of this theory.

**Conclusion:** No hidden non-Boolean token can belong to T. ∎

### 5.3 Corollary: The Epistemic Loophole Closed

**Corollary.** The L₃ constraints on measurement outcomes are ontic (constitutive of outcome tokens) rather than epistemic (imposed by observation).

By the Ontic Booleanity theorem:
- Tokens with positive probability must be Boolean (Part I)
- Tokens with zero probability cannot violate L₃ and belong to T (Part II)

Therefore, every token in T satisfies L₃. The constraint is on the tokens themselves, not on our access to them.

### 5.4 Implication for Many-Worlds

This theorem is devastating for MWI's claim that "all branches are equally real":

1. **MWI claims:** All branches of the wave function are physically instantiated.
2. **Ontic Booleanity proves:** Only L₃-admissible configurations can be physically instantiated.
3. **Therefore:** If MWI branches exist, they must each individually satisfy L₃.

But this means each "branch" is not a superposition but a determinate, L₃-consistent record. The branches are not "all equally real"—they are L₃-admissible alternatives, exactly one of which is actualized per measurement context.

The MWI interpretation collapses into a many-records view, but without the ontological inflation: only one record exists at each measurement.

## 6. Spacetime as Compatibility Structure

### 6.1 Temporal Ordering from Joint Inadmissibility

The MVS framework extends naturally to spacetime structure. Consider pairs of configurations c₁, c₂ ∈ A_Ω (the set of L₃-admissible configurations).

**Definition (Joint Admissibility).** Configurations c₁, c₂ are *jointly admissible* if their conjunction is also admissible:
$$c_1 \land c_2 \in A_\Omega$$

**Definition (Joint Inadmissibility).** Configurations c₁, c₂ are *jointly inadmissible* if:
$$c_1 \land c_2 \notin A_\Omega$$

This occurs when the conjunction violates NC—for instance, "particle at position x₁" and "same particle at position x₂ ≠ x₁" at the same time.

**Theorem (Temporal Ordering).** If two L₃-admissible configurations are jointly inadmissible but both are instantiated, then they must be temporally ordered.

*Proof sketch.* Suppose c₁, c₂ ∈ A_Ω but c₁ ∧ c₂ ∉ A_Ω. If both c₁ and c₂ are instantiated, they cannot be co-instantiated (since their conjunction violates L₃). Three options:

1. Only c₁ is instantiated (not c₂)
2. Only c₂ is instantiated (not c₁)
3. Both are instantiated, but at different "times"

Option 3 requires an ordering relation: "c₁ before c₂" or "c₂ before c₁".

**Definition**: The *temporal ordering* < on instantiated configurations is the minimal ordering such that jointly-inadmissible but both-instantiated configurations are separated:
$$c_1 \land c_2 \notin A_\Omega \text{ and both instantiated} \Rightarrow c_1 < c_2 \text{ or } c_2 < c_1$$

**Conclusion**: Time emerges as the logical sequencing necessitated by joint inadmissibility. ∎

### 6.2 Causality as L₃ Gate

The causal structure of spacetime can be understood as the "logic gate" of the MVS:

**Temporal ordering:** Time exists specifically to permit the R(I) → L(I) mapping. A configuration in superposition at t₁ resolves to a determinate record at t₂. The temporal interval provides the "space" for this logical transition.

**Causality:** Causal structure ensures that information flows in directions that prevent L₃-violating paradoxes (e.g., retrocausal contradictions).

**Lorentzian signature:** The specific (3+1) signature of spacetime may be the unique geometry permitting L₃-consistent physics with the observed matter content.

### 6.3 Status

These spacetime claims are **conjectural extensions**. They are noted here to indicate the potential scope of the MVS framework, not as established results. Full derivation requires additional development (see GR Extension Paper, Longmire 2025).

---

## 7. Falsifiability

The MVS hypothesis makes specific, testable claims:

### 7.1 Primary Predictions

1. **Born statistics are necessary:** No L₃-consistent measurement process can yield non-Born probability distributions. Any reproducible experiment demonstrating stable macroscopic records with non-|ψ|² statistics would falsify LRT.

2. **Hilbert space is unique:** No alternative mathematical structure (real Hilbert space, quaternionic, etc.) can satisfy L₃ constraints while matching quantum phenomena. The Renou et al. (2021) experimental falsification of real-number quantum theory is a **successful LRT prediction**: LRT derives (via local tomography from Id) that complex numbers are required.

3. **No stable contradictions:** No physical system can maintain a stable, publicly accessible record that instantiates a formal contradiction. Any such observation would directly falsify L₃ as a physical constraint.

4. **Ontic Booleanity:** The L₃ constraints apply to outcome tokens themselves, not just observed outcomes. Any demonstration that hidden non-Boolean tokens exist (through indirect effects) would falsify the Ontic Booleanity theorem.

### 7.2 Distinguishing LRT from MWI

Both theories predict identical measurement statistics. The distinction is ontological, not empirical at the level of individual experiments. However:

- **Macroscopic superposition tests:** If MWI is correct, macroscopic superpositions exist but are inaccessible due to decoherence. LRT predicts such superpositions are not instantiated at all—only L₃-admissible configurations exist. Experiments pushing decoherence boundaries (optomechanical systems, large-molecule interferometry) test how far superposition extends before L₃ filtering occurs.

- **Collapse model tests:** Objective collapse models (GRW, Penrose-Diósi) predict deviations from unitary evolution. LRT is agnostic on the mechanism of L₃ enforcement but predicts that whatever mechanism exists, it produces Born statistics and L₃-consistent records.

### 7.3 What Would Falsify LRT

| Observation | What It Would Show |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Non-Born statistics in stable records | L₃ does not uniquely determine probability measure |
| Real-number QM experimentally confirmed | Local tomography not required by Id |
| Stable contradictory record | L₃ not constitutive of physical instantiation |
| Macroscopic interference at arbitrary scale | L₃ filtering doesn't occur; MWI preferred |

---

## 8. Conclusion: The Logical Limit of Physics

The Minimal Viable Set hypothesis proposes that physical law is the structure of logical admissibility. We do not inhabit one branch among infinitely many; we inhabit the L₃-consistent configuration that *can* be inhabited.

The complexity of quantum mechanics—superposition, entanglement, interference—describes the mathematical space of representable configurations (R(I)). The classical world—determinate, consistent, recordable—is L(I): what survives the filter of logical admissibility.

The Born rule is not mysterious. It is the unique probability measure on the structure that L₃ forces (§3.4). Measurement is not collapse. It is logical selection (§3.2). The L₃ constraints are not epistemic filters but ontic requirements (§5). The universe is not maximally realized (MWI) but maximally consistent (LRT).

**The laws of physics are the rules of logical stability.**
