# IIS-LRT THREE-STAGE FRAMEWORK
## Revised Version

---

## CORE STRUCTURE

### Stage 1: REPRESENTABLE (IIS)
- **Contains**: All formally specifiable information structures
- **Includes**: Logically incoherent structures (P∧¬P configurations, impossible geometries, paraconsistent objects)
- **Character**: Maximal, unconstrained, purely formal/mathematical
- **Status**: Not physical state space; the arena of conceptual possibility
- **Role**: Grounds anti-psychologism; shows LRT is non-trivial (there ARE formal representations of violations)

### Stage 2: PERMISSIBLE (LRT-filtered)
- **Contains**: The subset of Stage 1 satisfying LOI/LNC/LEM
- **Character**: Logically coherent information structures that could be physically instantiated
- **Status**: This is where physics lives; quantum states and wavefunctions belong here
- **Key point**: Stage 1→2 is STRUCTURAL, not processual; not something that "happens" in time
- **Born probabilities**: Defined as a measure ON this stage (over permissible outcomes)

### Stage 3: ACTUAL (Instantiated)
- **Contains**: The single outcome that becomes the measurement record
- **Selected from**: Stage 2 (Permissible) states according to Born probabilities
- **Character**: Determinate, recorded, irreversible
- **Key point**: Stage 2→3 is where dynamics and probability operate
- **Selection mechanism**: Orthogonal question (objective chance, hidden variables, relational) - IIS-LRT constrains candidates, not the selection process

## THREE DISTINCT QUESTIONS

| # | Question | Answer | Domain |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | What is representable? | Everything in IIS (all formally specifiable structures) | Mathematical/formal |
| 2 | What is permissible? | Everything satisfying LRT (logically coherent structures) | Physical possibility |
| 3 | What is actual? | One outcome selected from the permissible set (with Born probability) | Physical actuality |

---

## TRANSITION TYPES

### Stage 1 → Stage 2: STRUCTURAL
- Not a process or event
- Not temporal
- LRT defines the boundary; nothing "filters" in time
- **Analogy**: The relationship between all grammatical sentences and all true sentences - truth doesn't "filter" grammar in time

### Stage 2 → Stage 3: DYNAMICAL
- Involves time, interaction, measurement
- Where Born probabilities apply
- Where "measurement problem" questions live
- Selection mechanism is interpretation-dependent

---

## WHERE THINGS LIVE

| Element | Stage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Wavefunctions/Quantum States | Stage 2 | Already LRT-compliant; never yield contradictions |
| Paraconsistent Structures | Stage 1 only | Formally specifiable but not physically instantiable |
| Born Probabilities | Measure on Stage 2 | Defined over permissible outcomes |
| Superposition | Stage 2 property | Multiple Stage 3 candidates with Born weights |

### Details:

**Wavefunctions/Quantum States: Stage 2**
- A pure quantum state ψ is already LRT-compliant
- Its Born probabilities for well-defined observables never yield contradictions in single outcome records
- Physical quantum mechanics operates entirely within Stage 2

**Paraconsistent Structures: Stage 1 only**
- Formally specifiable but not physically instantiable
- Exist as mathematical objects
- Excluded from Stage 2 by LRT

**Born Probabilities: Measure on Stage 2**
- Defined over permissible outcomes
- "Probable" is a property of Stage 2 elements, not the stage name
- Probabilities make sense only for LRT-compliant states

**Superposition: Stage 2 property**
- Superposition is a feature of permissible quantum states
- Not a violation of LNC because LNC applies to actualized records (Stage 3)
- Superposition = multiple Stage 3 candidates with Born weights

---

## WHAT IIS-LRT SOLVES VS. LEAVES OPEN

### SOLVES:
- Why no contradictions in measurement records (LRT forbids them at Stage 2)
- Why definite outcomes exist (only LRT-compliant states can be actualized)
- Where probabilities are meaningful (on the permissible subspace)
- Why psychologism fails (Stage 1 shows we can represent what Stage 2 forbids)

### LEAVES OPEN (explicitly):
- Why THIS outcome rather than another (selection mechanism)
- Derivation of Born rule from deeper principles (candidate approaches exist)
- Whether selection is deterministic or stochastic
- Compatibility with various interpretations (objective chance, hidden variables, relational)

## DISTINGUISHING FROM "STANDARD QM + CLASSICAL LOGIC"

| Aspect | Standard QM + Classical Logic | IIS-LRT |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Logic status | Presupposed as background assumption | IS a physical postulate |
| Physical postulates | Logic not part of them | LOI/LNC/LEM explicitly constrain state spaces |
| Classical apparatus | Assumed to yield definite outcomes | Explained via LRT constraint |
| Why outcomes respect logic | No explanation | Falsifiable: macroscopic P∧¬P would refute |
| Ontology | Varies by interpretation | Integrated with information ontology |

**The key move**: ELEVATION of logical laws from background assumption to falsifiable physical constraint.

## MWI COMPARISON (clarified)

### MWI structure:
- Stage 1: (implicit) all mathematical structures
- Stage 2: Quantum states (Hilbert space)
- Stage 3: ALL permissible outcomes actualize in different branches

### IIS-LRT structure:
- Stage 1: All representable structures (IIS)
- Stage 2: LRT-permissible structures (where QM operates)
- Stage 3: ONE outcome actualizes; others remain merely permissible

**Key difference**: Same Stage 1 and Stage 2; different Stage 3 ontology.
- MWI multiplies actuality
- IIS-LRT does not
- **Parsimony favors IIS-LRT**

## REVISED SLOGAN

```
REPRESENTABLE (all formal structures)
    ↓ [structural: LRT defines boundary]
PERMISSIBLE (LRT-compliant; physics lives here; Born measure defined here)
    ↓ [dynamical: selection with probability]
ACTUAL (single outcome recorded)
```

## QUANTUM MECHANICS AS DUAL-DOMAIN THEORY

QM operates in BOTH Stage 1 and Stage 2:

### Stage 2 (Physical):
- Wavefunctions, Hilbert space, unitary evolution
- Born probabilities over outcomes
- Measurement records
- Everything that yields empirical predictions

### Stage 1 (Representational):
- The formalism represents superpositions interpretable as "P and not-P"
- Mathematical structures that motivate logic-revision proposals
- Quantum logic (Birkhoff-von Neumann), paraconsistent interpretations
- The arena where interpretive debates occur

### Why this matters:
This dual residence explains why QM is the testing ground for logic:
- The mathematics lives partly in Stage 1 (structures resembling LNC violations)
- All actual outcomes live in Stage 2 (never violating LRT)
- **Interpretive question**: do Stage 1 representations have ontological weight?

### How interpretations map onto stages:
| Interpretation | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| MWI | Structures become actual | Quantum states | ALL outcomes actual (branches) |
| Copenhagen | Calculation only | Instrumental | All that's real |
| Bohmian | -- | Contains hidden variables | Determined by HVs |
| IIS-LRT | Representable, not instantiable | Physical possibility | ONE outcome |

### Dissolving the physics/metaphysics policing problem:
- QM itself does not respect the traditional boundary
- The formalism simultaneously predicts outcomes (physical) and raises existence questions (metaphysical)
- IIS-LRT makes this explicit: Stage 1 is representational, Stages 2-3 are physical
- The boundary is relocated from disciplines to stages
- Any QM interpretation involves metaphysical commitments; the question is which ones, not whether
- IIS-LRT is explicit: logical structure is physical structure at the fundamental level
- The question is not "physics or metaphysics?" but "what is the structure of reality?" - IIS-LRT answers in explicitly logical-informational terms

## PROBABILITY AS OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE: THE "OPPORTUNISTIC" MODEL

### Traditional framing poses a binary:
- **Deterministic**: Outcome fixed by prior state; probability is epistemic (ignorance)
- **Stochastic**: Outcome genuinely random; probability is ontic (irreducible chance)

### IIS-LRT proposes a level-sorted alternative: OPPORTUNISTIC

**Core idea**:
- Stage 2: Born weights define the objective structure of available opportunities
- Stage 3: Actualization selects definitively from that structure
- Probability describes Stage 2 structure; actuality describes Stage 3
- Neither is reducible to the other

**Key features**:
- Probability is the structure of opportunity within the permissible - objective, not epistemic
- Outcomes are definite once actualized - not indeterminate
- Selection mechanism is left open (could be deterministic at deeper level, or not)
- This disambiguates levels rather than solving the metaphysics of probability

### How this differs from other approaches:

| Approach | Probability is... | Actuality is... |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| MWI | Self-location uncertainty | All outcomes actual |
| GRW | Fundamental stochastic dynamics | Collapse result |
| Bohmian | Ignorance of hidden variables | Determined by HVs |
| IIS-LRT | Stage 2 opportunity structure | Stage 3 selection |

**Status**: This is proposed as a useful way to sort levels (Stage 2 dynamics vs. Stage 3 selection), not as a final analysis of probability. Further development is future work.

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

1. Mathematical formalization of IIS and the LRT-permissible subspace
2. Derivation of Born rule from IIS-LRT structure
3. Relationship to specific interpretations (GRW, Bohmian, relational)
4. Application to quantum gravity (where Hilbert space structure may not apply)
5. Whether Stage 2→3 transition is fundamental or emergent (decoherence)

**This framing is ready for incorporation into the main paper outline.**
