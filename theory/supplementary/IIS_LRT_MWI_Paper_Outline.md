## ABSTRACT

This paper develops an information-theoretic framework for quantum foundations by combining Logic Realism Theory (LRT) with the concept of an Infinite Information Space (IIS). We propose a three-stage ontological structure: (1) REPRESENTABLE - all formally specifiable information structures, including logically incoherent ones; (2) PERMISSIBLE - the subset satisfying the classical laws of logic (LOI, LNC, LEM), where quantum states live and Born probabilities are defined; (3) ACTUAL - the single outcome selected from the permissible set in any measurement. The transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 is structural (LRT defines the boundary), while Stage 2 to Stage 3 is dynamical (where probability and selection operate).

This framework yields several results. First, it cleanly separates representational capacity (Stage 1), physical possibility (Stage 2), and actuality (Stage 3), grounding the distinction between conceptual and nomological possibility. Second, it locates quantum mechanics entirely within Stage 2: superpositions are Stage 2 structures with multiple Stage 3 candidates weighted by Born probabilities, not violations of classical logic. Third, it obviates the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI). Both frameworks share Stages 1 and 2, but diverge at Stage 3: MWI makes all permissible outcomes actual (in different branches), while IIS-LRT makes one outcome actual. Since both explain why no contradictions appear in measurement records, parsimony favors IIS-LRT.

We argue this framework elevates classical logic from background assumption to falsifiable physical constraint, is empirically equivalent to standard QM, and provides a more parsimonious alternative to MWI. The selection mechanism at Stage 2→3 is left open, compatible with various interpretations; IIS-LRT constrains the candidates, not the selection process.

### III. INFINITE INFORMATION SPACE (IIS) AND THE THREE-STAGE FRAMEWORK

A. The three-stage structure
   1. Stage 1 - REPRESENTABLE (IIS): All formally specifiable information structures
      a. Includes logically incoherent structures (P∧¬P, impossible geometries)
      b. Purely formal/mathematical arena
      c. Not physical state space; arena of conceptual possibility
      d. Role: grounds anti-psychologism; shows LRT is non-trivial
   2. Stage 2 - PERMISSIBLE (LRT-filtered): Subset of IIS satisfying LOI/LNC/LEM
      a. Logically coherent structures that could be physically instantiated
      b. This is where physics lives; quantum states belong here
      c. Born probabilities defined as measure ON this stage
   3. Stage 3 - ACTUAL (Instantiated): Single outcome selected from Stage 2
      a. Determinate, recorded, irreversible
      b. Selection mechanism orthogonal to IIS-LRT framework

B. Transition types
   1. Stage 1→2: STRUCTURAL (not processual)
      a. LRT defines the boundary; nothing "filters" in time
      b. Not a collapse or temporal process
      c. Analogy: relationship between grammatical sentences and true sentences
   2. Stage 2→3: DYNAMICAL
      a. Involves time, interaction, measurement
      b. Where Born probabilities apply
      c. Selection mechanism is interpretation-dependent

C. Quantum mechanics as dual-domain theory
   1. QM operates in BOTH Stage 1 and Stage 2
      a. Stage 2 (Physical): Wavefunctions, Hilbert space, unitary evolution, Born probabilities, measurement outcomes
      b. Stage 1 (Representational): The formalism represents superpositions interpretable as "P and not-P"; motivates logic-revision proposals
   2. This dual residence explains why QM is the testing ground for logic
      a. The mathematics lives partly in Stage 1 (structures that look like LNC violations)
      b. All actual outcomes live in Stage 2 (never violating LRT)
      c. The interpretive question: do Stage 1 representations have ontological weight?
   3. How interpretations map onto the stages:
      a. MWI: Stage 1 mathematical structure becomes Stage 3 actual (in all branches)
      b. Copenhagen: Stage 1 is calculation only; Stage 3 is all that's real; Stage 2 is instrumental
      c. Bohmian: Stage 2 contains hidden variables; Stage 3 determined by them
      d. IIS-LRT: Stage 1 is representable but not instantiable; Stage 2 is physical possibility; Stage 3 is one outcome
   4. The physics/metaphysics boundary reconsidered
      a. QM itself does not respect the traditional boundary: the formalism simultaneously predicts outcomes (physical) and raises existence questions (metaphysical)
      b. IIS-LRT makes this explicit: Stage 1 is representational, Stages 2-3 are physical
      c. The boundary is relocated from disciplines to stages
      d. Any QM interpretation involves metaphysical commitments; the question is which ones, not whether
      e. IIS-LRT is explicit about its commitments: logical structure is physical structure at the fundamental level
      f. The question is not "physics or metaphysics?" but "what is the structure of reality?" - IIS-LRT answers in explicitly logical-informational terms

D. Information-theoretic ontology
   1. Wheeler's "it from bit" and subsequent developments
   2. Information as ontologically basic, not merely epistemic
   3. Grounding in Logos: rational structure as the basis for physical existence
   4. Distinguishing IIS-LRT from Copenhagen, QBism, and information-theoretic collapse
      a. Ontic vs. epistemic: IIS-LRT treats information and logical constraints as ontic
      b. Logical realism is stronger than operationalism
      c. Falsifiability distinguishes from Copenhagen-style apparatus talk

E. Defining IIS: Formal Characterization
   1. IIS as structured category of information states
      a. Elements: all formally specifiable information configurations
      b. Structure: morphisms representing transformations between states
      c. Substructures: embeddings of specific state spaces
   2. Key property distinguishing IIS from Hilbert space:
      a. IIS includes classical phase spaces and Boolean information structures as subregions
      b. IIS includes formally specifiable but logically incoherent structures (Stage 1)
      c. IIS accommodates non-Hilbert structures relevant to quantum gravity
      d. IIS is a schema unifying different state spaces via information-theoretic constraints
   3. Toy formalization (preliminary):
      a. IIS as large structured set whose elements are information states
      b. LRT-permissible subspace as where physics operates
      c. Hilbert spaces, configuration spaces, phase spaces as functorially embedded in permissible subspace

F. IIS vs. Hilbert space
   1. Hilbert space as subset of Stage 2 (permissible structures)
   2. Why IIS is more fundamental: includes both permissible and representable-but-forbidden structures
   3. IIS accommodates information structures beyond standard QM (quantum gravity, cosmology)
   4. IIS is not "adding new stuff": it generalizes and abstracts what existing state spaces share

---

### IV. SYNTHESIS: LRT AS CONSTRAINT ON IIS

A. What IIS-LRT solves vs. leaves open
   1. SOLVES:
      a. Why no contradictions in measurement records (LRT forbids at Stage 2)
      b. Why definite outcomes exist (only LRT-compliant states can be actualized)
      c. Where probabilities are meaningful (on the permissible subspace)
      d. Why psychologism fails (Stage 1 shows we can represent what Stage 2 forbids)
   2. LEAVES OPEN (explicitly):
      a. Why THIS outcome rather than another (selection mechanism)
      b. Derivation of Born rule from deeper principles
      c. Whether selection is deterministic or stochastic
      d. Compatible with multiple interpretations (objective chance, hidden variables, relational)

B. Probability as opportunity structure: the "opportunistic" model
   1. Traditional framing poses a binary:
      a. Deterministic: outcome fixed by prior state; probability is epistemic (ignorance)
      b. Stochastic: outcome genuinely random; probability is ontic (irreducible chance)
   2. IIS-LRT proposes a level-sorted alternative: OPPORTUNISTIC
      a. Stage 2: Born weights define the objective structure of available opportunities
      b. Stage 3: Actualization selects definitively from that structure
      c. Probability describes Stage 2 structure; actuality describes Stage 3
      d. Neither is reducible to the other
   3. Key features:
      a. Probability is the structure of opportunity within the permissible - objective, not epistemic
      b. Outcomes are definite once actualized - not indeterminate
      c. Selection mechanism is left open (could be deterministic at deeper level, or not)
      d. This disambiguates levels rather than solving the metaphysics of probability
   4. How this differs from other approaches:
      a. MWI: all outcomes actual; probability = self-location uncertainty
      b. GRW: stochastic collapse as fundamental dynamics
      c. Bohmian: deterministic hidden variables; probability = ignorance
      d. IIS-LRT: probability is Stage 2 opportunity structure; actuality is Stage 3 selection
   5. Status: This is proposed as a useful way to sort levels (Stage 2 dynamics vs. Stage 3 selection), not as a final analysis of probability. Further development is future work.

C. LRT as structural boundary, not dynamical filter
   1. LOI, LNC, LEM define Stage 2 boundary
   2. Not a process that happens in time
   3. Actualization = selection from Stage 2 according to Born measure
   4. Contrast with collapse: collapse is dynamical; LRT constraint is structural

D. Where wavefunctions and superpositions live
   1. Wavefunctions belong in Stage 2 (already LRT-compliant)
      a. A pure quantum state ψ never yields contradictions in outcome records
      b. Physical quantum mechanics operates entirely within Stage 2
   2. Superposition as Stage 2 property
      a. Multiple Stage 3 candidates with Born weights
      b. Not a violation of LNC: LNC applies to actualized records (Stage 3)
      c. No contradiction in formalism; no contradiction in outcome
   3. Stage 1 "incoherents" are purely formal
      a. Mathematically specifiable structures that would violate logic if physical
      b. Exist as representations only
      c. Excluded from Stage 2 by definition

E. The Born rule question: preliminary approaches
   1. The problem: LRT explains why no contradictions, not why specific outcomes with specific probabilities
   2. Born probabilities as measure on Stage 2:
      a. Defined over permissible outcomes
      b. "Probable" is property of Stage 2 elements, not the stage itself
   3. Candidate derivation approaches:
      a. Measure-theoretic: natural measure on IIS, Born weights as restriction to permissible subspace
      b. Symmetry-based: Born rule as unique measure invariant under relevant IIS transformations
      c. Information-theoretic: Born weights as optimal information compression under LRT constraints
   4. Comparison to MWI's Born rule problem (decision-theoretic approaches, branch counting)
   5. Status: open problem, but IIS-LRT is no worse off than MWI here

F. Subsuming existing formalisms
   1. Hilbert space as subset of Stage 2
   2. Configuration space, phase space as projections within Stage 2
   3. Quantum logic (Birkhoff-von Neumann) as alternative navigation of Stage 2
   4. All yield LRT-compliant outcomes (Stage 3)

G. Worked example: Spin-1/2 system
   1. Standard Hilbert space representation: C^2 (lives in Stage 2)
   2. Superposition |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) as Stage 2 state
      a. Informational structure with two Stage 3 candidates
      b. Both |up> and |down> outcomes are permissible
      c. Born measure assigns 50% to each
   3. Measurement as Stage 2→3 transition
      a. Selection of one outcome from permissible set
      b. Result: either "up" or "down", never both (LRT satisfied)
      c. Mechanism of selection: interpretation-dependent
   4. What IIS-LRT adds: explicit grounding for why contradictory outcomes are impossible

### V. OBVIATING MANY-WORLDS

A. MWI's explanatory structure
   1. Problem: deterministic Schrodinger evolution + definite outcomes
   2. MWI solution: all branches exist; observer finds self in one
   3. Cost: ontological explosion (infinite branching worlds)

B. MWI vs. IIS-LRT in three-stage terms
   1. Shared structure:
      a. Stage 1 (Representable): Both accept formal representability of structures
      b. Stage 2 (Permissible): Both operate with quantum states in Hilbert space
   2. Divergence at Stage 3:
      a. MWI: ALL Stage 2 outcomes become actual (in different branches)
      b. IIS-LRT: ONE Stage 2 outcome becomes actual; others remain permissible
   3. The explanandum: why no contradictions in measurement records
      a. MWI answer: branching prevents contradictions from co-occurring in one branch
      b. IIS-LRT answer: LRT defines Stage 2 such that only non-contradictory outcomes are candidates
   4. Side-by-side:
      a. MWI: {unitary dynamics + branching ontology} => no P∧¬P in any single branch
      b. IIS-LRT: {unitary dynamics + LRT constraint on Stage 2} => no P∧¬P in any actualized record
      c. Same explanandum, different explanans; IIS-LRT does not multiply worlds

C. Parsimony argument (explicit comparison)
   1. What MWI posits: infinite branches of one universal wavefunction; all permissible outcomes actual
   2. What IIS-LRT posits: three-stage structure with one actual outcome per measurement
   3. Counting ontology consistently:
      a. Both accept infinite-dimensional state spaces
      b. MWI adds: all outcomes actual in branching structure
      c. IIS-LRT adds: LRT as physical constraint (but no multiplication of actuality)
   4. Trade-off: MWI gets determinism and no collapse, but pays with ontological explosion
   5. IIS-LRT gets no collapse (Stage 1→2 is structural, not dynamical) without ontological explosion
   6. Parsimony favors IIS-LRT: same explanatory work, fewer actual entities

D. Addressing MWI advantages
   1. Determinism:
      a. IIS-LRT can accommodate determinism at the information level (Stage 1-2)
      b. Stage 2→3 may involve objective probability (compatible with various mechanisms)
      c. Determinism is a desideratum, not a requirement; parsimony may outweigh it
   2. No collapse:
      a. Stage 1→2 is structural, not dynamical (no collapse there)
      b. Stage 2→3 is selection, not collapse (state doesn't change; one candidate becomes actual)
      c. No modification to Schrodinger equation
   3. Elegance of universal wavefunction:
      a. IIS provides analogous unification: single information space (Stage 1) containing all structures
      b. Unity without branching actuality
   4. Preferred basis problem:
      a. MWI faces this: what determines the branching basis?
      b. IIS-LRT: basis for actualization determined by what produces LRT-compliant records (pointer observables, decoherence)

### VI. THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM REFRAMED

A. Traditional framing
   1. When/how does the wavefunction collapse?
   2. What counts as a measurement?
   3. Observer's role

B. IIS-LRT reframing via three stages
   1. Stage 1→2 is structural: no collapse, just the definition of permissible states
   2. Stage 2→3 is selection: one outcome from permissible set becomes actual
   3. "Collapse" language is misleading:
      a. Nothing collapses; quantum state doesn't change
      b. One candidate from the Born-weighted set becomes the record
      c. This is selection, not state modification
   4. Measurement = Stage 2→3 transition
      a. Any physical interaction producing determinate record
      b. Observer not privileged

C. What IIS-LRT explains vs. relocates
   1. EXPLAINS: Why outcomes are always LRT-compliant (no contradictions)
      - Stage 2 is defined by LRT; Stage 3 is selected from Stage 2
   2. RELOCATES: Why this particular outcome
      - Selection mechanism left open
      - Compatible with objective chance, hidden variables, relational approaches
   3. This is progress, not evasion:
      - "Why no contradictions?" is answered
      - "Why this outcome?" is orthogonal
      - Standard QM doesn't answer either; MWI answers both via branching (but at ontological cost)

D. Decoherence and the classical limit
   1. Decoherence as information-theoretic process within Stage 2
   2. Decoherence selects pointer basis (determines which Stage 3 outcomes are distinguishable)
   3. Classical world: regime where Stage 2→3 transitions are rapid and ubiquitous
   4. No sharp quantum/classical boundary; gradual transition

E. Distinguishing from "standard QM + classical logic"
   1. Standard QM + classical logic:
      a. Logic presupposed as background assumption
      b. Not part of physical postulates
      c. Classical apparatus assumed to yield definite outcomes
      d. No explanation of WHY outcomes respect logic
   2. IIS-LRT:
      a. Logic IS a physical postulate (defines Stage 2)
      b. LOI/LNC/LEM explicitly constrain admissible states
      c. Falsifiable: macroscopic P∧¬P would refute
      d. Integrated with information ontology
   3. The key move: ELEVATION of logical laws from background assumption to falsifiable physical constraint

---

### VII. IMPLICATIONS AND PREDICTIONS

A. Empirical equivalence with standard QM
   1. All predictions preserved
   2. IIS-LRT is interpretive framework, not alternative dynamics
   3. No modification to Schrodinger equation or Born rule

B. Potential divergences (honest assessment)
   1. At present: interpretive divergence only; no known empirical separation from MWI
   2. Candidate regimes where differences might appear:
      a. Exotic causal structures (closed timelike curves, if physically realizable)
      b. Quantum gravity at Planck scale (where Hilbert space structure may break down)
      c. Cosmological scenarios (early universe, where "measurement" is problematic)
   3. Predictive separation is future work; current paper establishes conceptual framework

C. Philosophical implications
   1. Ontic status of logic: LOI/LNC/LEM as physically fundamental
   2. Information as fundamental: not merely epistemic but constitutive of reality
   3. Relationship to Logos: rational structure as ground of physical existence
   4. Connection to logical realism literature (Sher, etc.)

---

### VIII. OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES

A. "This is just Copenhagen with extra steps"
   Response: Copenhagen is silent on why outcomes are definite; IIS-LRT grounds definiteness in logical structure. Copenhagen treats the classical/quantum divide as primitive; IIS-LRT explains it via LRT constraints on actualization. Copenhagen is operationalist/epistemic; IIS-LRT is ontic.

B. "LRT is unfalsifiable"
   Response: Falsification criterion is precise and operationally specifiable (see LRT paper). Macroscopic P and not-P in same respect would falsify. The criterion is clearer than MWI's (which has no falsification condition internal to the interpretation).

C. "IIS is too vague / not mathematically rigorous"
   Response: Preliminary characterization provided (Section III.E). Rigorous formalization is future work, but the structural features distinguishing IIS from Hilbert space are specified. This is a research program, not a finished theory.

D. "You haven't really eliminated collapse"
   Response: Actualization under LRT is not a physical process but a logical constraint; different in kind from collapse. Collapse is dynamical (happens in time, modifies state); LRT constraint is structural (determines which states can be actualized). No modification to unitary dynamics.

E. "MWI is more elegant / unified"
   Response: Elegance is not the sole criterion; parsimony matters. IIS provides unification (single information space) without ontological explosion (no branching worlds). If elegance and parsimony conflict, parsimony should win absent empirical difference.

F. "You've just relocated the measurement problem to 'actualization'"
   Response: Partially true, but the relocation is explanatory progress. "Actualization under LRT" is not a mysterious physical process but the application of logical boundary conditions. The question "why this outcome?" remains open (Born rule), but "why definite outcomes at all?" is answered (LRT forbids contradictions). MWI also faces the Born rule problem; IIS-LRT is no worse off.

G. "Why should logic be ontic rather than epistemic?"
   Response: See LRT paper for full argument. Key points: (1) conceptual/nomological distinction shows logic is not merely cognitive; (2) virtuous circularity is expected for foundational principles; (3) falsifiability gives empirical traction.

   4. Characterization of LRT-compliant subspace

   2. Symmetry approach: uniqueness theorems for probability measures under IIS transformations
   3. Information-theoretic approach: Born rule from information-compression principles
   4. Comparison to existing derivation attempts (Gleason, Zurek, Wallace)

### X. CONCLUSION

A. Summary of framework
   1. Three-stage structure:
      a. Stage 1 (Representable): all formally specifiable information structures
      b. Stage 2 (Permissible): LRT-compliant structures where physics lives
      c. Stage 3 (Actual): single outcome selected per measurement
   2. Transition types:
      a. Stage 1→2: structural (LRT defines boundary)
      b. Stage 2→3: dynamical (selection with Born probability)
   3. Quantum states in Stage 2; superposition = multiple Stage 3 candidates

B. Main result: MWI obviated
   1. MWI and IIS-LRT share Stages 1 and 2
   2. Diverge at Stage 3: MWI actualizes all; IIS-LRT actualizes one

   4. Parsimony favors IIS-LRT: fewer actual entities

C. What IIS-LRT solves vs. leaves open
   1. SOLVES: Why no contradictions (LRT defines Stage 2); why definite outcomes possible
   2. LEAVES OPEN: Why this particular outcome (selection mechanism); Born rule derivation
   3. This is progress: "why no contradictions?" answered; "why this outcome?" orthogonal

D. The key move
   1. Elevation of classical logic from background assumption to falsifiable physical constraint
   2. Integration with information ontology via three-stage structure
   3. Not "QM + we assume logic" but "logic as physical postulate constraining state space"

E. Broader significance
   1. Logic as physically foundational: a realist thesis with empirical traction
   2. Information-theoretic ontology grounded in rational structure (Logos)
   3. Measurement problem partially dissolved (why definite outcomes) rather than fully solved (which outcome)
   4. Research program with clear next steps: formalize IIS, derive Born rule, apply to case studies
