## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) proposes a radical foundation for physics, asserting that the physical world ($\mathcal{A}$) is not merely governed by logic, but constituted by it. This framework resolves foundational crises, particularly in quantum mechanics, by establishing the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)—Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle—as prescriptive, ontological filters. The theory's core thesis is formalized as $\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$, where an infinite possibility space ($\mathcal{I}$) is actualized only upon satisfaction of the Logical Filtering Operator ($\mathfrak{L}$). This paper defines the primitives of LRT and proposes two falsification criteria—one experimental, targeting sustained logical violations in actualized macroscopic systems, and one metaphysical, challenging the informational substrate—that, despite practical difficulty, establish genuine scientific risk.

## 1. Introduction: The Crisis of Axiomatic Physics

Contemporary physics, particularly in the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM), relies on axioms (e.g., the Born rule, measurement collapse) that describe phenomena without underlying necessity. This instrumentalism generates deep philosophical quandaries about physical reality.[^1] LRT resolves this crisis by relocating physical law from the empirical to the **ontological** realm of logical necessity.

LRT aligns with informational ontologies,[^2] but uniquely claims **prescriptive logic**: logical structure is not descriptive, but *causal*—the origin of actuality itself.

## 2. The Core Thesis: Actuality as Filtered Possibility

The architecture of LRT is:
$$
\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})
$$
Physical reality ($\mathcal{A}$) is the constrained subset of an infinite possibility space ($\mathcal{I}$), filtered by the Logical Filtering Operator ($\mathfrak{L}$).

### 2.1. The Ontological Primitive: Infinite Information Space ($\mathcal{I}$)

$\mathcal{I}$ is the pre-physical totality of all logically possible configurations, including contradictions (round squares) and superpositions. It is the substrate of existence—analogous to the Humean Mosaic, but defined by **information**.[^3]

### 2.2. The Logical Primitive: The Filtering Operator ($\mathfrak{L}$)

$\mathfrak{L}$ comprises the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL):

- **Identity** ($\mathfrak{L}_{\text{Id}}$): $A = A$
- **Non-Contradiction** ($\mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}}$): $\neg(A \land \neg A)$
- **Excluded Middle** ($\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$): $A \lor \neg A$

These are **ontological primitives**,[^4] not empirical generalizations. $\mathfrak{L}$ acts as selective pressure, resolving $\mathcal{I}$ into coherent $\mathcal{A}$.

### 2.3. Physical Actualization ($\mathcal{A}$)

$\mathcal{A}$ emerges when $\mathcal{I}$ satisfies $\mathfrak{L}$:

- **Coherence**: $\mathfrak{L}$ forces quantum logic's non-distributive lattice[^5] into a classical Boolean lattice upon measurement.
- **Measurement**: Collapse is not ad hoc, but the moment $\mathfrak{L}$ enforces $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ on a state entering $\mathcal{A}$.

## 3. Falsification Criteria

LRT satisfies falsifiability[^6] via two decisive criteria targeting its primitives.

### 3.1. Falsification by Failure of the Logical Constraint ($\mathfrak{L}$)

This criterion engages a century of quantum logic research[^5][^7][^8][^9] seeking violations of classical logic in physical systems.

#### 3.1.1. Quantum Logic & the Actuality Boundary

LRT predicts a **sharp ontological divide**:

- **In $\mathcal{I}$**: Superpositions violate $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ — states are indeterminate.
- **In $\mathcal{A}$**: All actualized states obey the 3FLL — every proposition is true or false.

The boundary is enforced by decoherence or measurement. Once actualized, a state **cannot** sustain logical indeterminacy.

#### 3.1.2. Falsifying Observations

LRT is falsified by a system that is:

1. **Macroscopically actual** (causally coupled to $\mathcal{A}$, affecting classical records), **and**
2. **Sustains** a reproducible violation of $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{NC}}$ or $\mathfrak{L}_{\text{EM}}$ beyond decoherence timescale.

**Examples**:
- A SQUID loop reliably registering **both** clockwise and counterclockwise currents *simultaneously*, with both outcomes propagating into macroscopic detectors.
- A particle yielding **both** Spin-Up and Spin-Down in the same basis, with results recorded by independent instruments.
- A system defying decoherence theory by maintaining coherence for $t \gg \tau$ while thermally coupled.

#### 3.1.3. Risk & Historical Parallel

LRT predicts: no such system will ever be found. This is risky—quantum foundations experiments push exactly this boundary.

Crucially, this prediction is distinct from other interpretations:
- **Many-Worlds** predicts no EM violations in observations, but via branching—both outcomes occur in different branches.
- **Copenhagen** remains agnostic about pre-measurement reality, treating collapse as axiomatic.
- **Bohmian mechanics** preserves definite values via hidden variables.

LRT alone claims a specific filtering mechanism ($\mathfrak{L}$) that actively enforces logical constraint at the boundary between indeterminate possibility ($\mathcal{I}$) and definite actuality ($\mathcal{A}$). If a macroscopic system were found sustaining logical indeterminacy while causally coupled to the classical world, it would specifically refute the filtering mechanism, not merely the general claim that "macroscopic quantum coherence is hard."

Consider special relativity (1905): faster-than-light signaling was forbidden from day one, yet no direct test was possible until mid-20th-century accelerators. The logical possibility of a superluminal signal rendered SR falsifiable despite technological lag. Similarly, LRT's criterion is logically coherent and experimentally pursued—establishing scientific risk.

### 3.2. Falsification by Failure of the Ontological Primitive ($\mathcal{I}$)

A superior theory with a **non-informational** foundational primitive (e.g., Bohmian particles, loop quantum gravity spin networks) that resolves QM paradoxes with greater elegance and predictive power would falsify $\mathcal{I}$ as necessary, collapsing the $\mathcal{A} = \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{I})$ framework.

## 4. Conclusion

LRT derives physical actuality from logical necessity, explaining macroscopic coherence and quantum indeterminacy within a unified ontology. While falsification via Criterion 3.1.2 may be experimentally remote, its **logical coherence and active pursuit in quantum foundations** secures LRT's status as a **scientifically risky** proposal in the metaphysics of physics.
