**Re: Submission of "Logic Realism Theory and Quantum Foundations: A Co-Constitutive Framework"**

Dear Dr. Gao,

I am pleased to submit the enclosed manuscript, "Logic Realism Theory and Quantum Foundations: A Co-Constitutive Framework," for consideration as a research note or normal paper in the International Journal of Quantum Foundations.

**Summary**

This paper introduces Logic Realism Theory (LRT), a framework proposing that physical reality is co-constituted by logical constraint operating on information space. The central thesis decomposes into:

- **Theorem 1** (empirically supported): No completed measurement violates the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle)
- **Conjecture 1** (open): Logical constraint on information suffices for physical actualization

**Relevance to IJQF**

The manuscript engages directly with topics central to quantum foundations:

1. **Quantum reconstruction**: LRT connects to the Masanes-Müller and Hardy reconstruction programs, asking whether their operational axioms are downstream of logical constraints
2. **Interpretation**: The co-constitutive framing addresses the over-generation problem that challenges Many-Worlds interpretations
3. **Empirical grounding**: Clear falsification conditions are articulated, distinguishing LRT from purely philosophical speculation

**Contribution**

The paper offers a novel perspective on the relationship between logic, information, and physical actualization. It maintains honest separation between proved components (Theorem 1) and open conjectures, avoiding overclaiming while presenting an ambitious research program.

I confirm that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by another journal. There are no conflicts of interest to declare.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
