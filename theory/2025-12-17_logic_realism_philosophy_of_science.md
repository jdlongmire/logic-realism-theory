## 1. Introduction: The Hidden Structure of Physical Theories

### 1.1 The Problem of Background Assumptions

Physical theories are typically presented as mathematical structures plus empirical interpretations. What often remains implicit are the background assumptions that make the mathematics coherent and applicable - assumptions about logic, distinguishability, continuity, and composition.

**Thesis statement:** We propose that the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) - Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle - function as constitutive constraints on any coherent physical theory, and that making this logic-first structure explicit illuminates the otherwise hidden dependencies between theoretical postulates.

### 1.2 The Logic Realism Thesis

**Definition:** The Logic Realism Thesis holds that 3FLL are not merely rules of valid reasoning but constitutive of coherent reality itself. All substantive axioms of mathematics and physics are downstream of this logical foundation - they are theorems of coherent structure, constrained by the requirement that reality be logically coherent.

**Important clarification:** This is a research conjecture and metaphysical thesis, not an established result of standard logic. In standard accounts, the laws of thought constrain reasoning but do not fix substantive content. Our claim is stronger: that 3FLL are *constitutive* of reality, not merely *descriptive* of valid inference.

### 1.3 Scope and Aims

This paper:
1. Articulates the logic-first structure of theories as a methodology
2. Introduces a tiered classification of assumptions (Tier 1-3)
3. Compares this approach with existing traditions in philosophy of science
4. Demonstrates the methodology through case studies from Logic Realism Theory

## 2. The Logic-First Structure of Theories

### 2.1 3FLL as Framing Conditions

The Three Fundamental Laws of Logic:

- **Identity (L₁):** ∀A: A = A
- **Non-Contradiction (L₂):** ∀A: ¬(A ∧ ¬A)
- **Excluded Middle (L₃):** ∀A: A ∨ ¬A

**Claim:** These are not optional axioms that could be otherwise. They are self-grounding: any attempt to deny them presupposes them. A theory violating L₂ collapses into triviality; a theory violating L₃ cannot make determinate claims; a theory violating L₁ cannot identify its own subject matter.

**Consequence:** 3FLL function as the deepest constraint on theory construction. They are not among the assumptions to be varied in underdetermination analysis - they are the preconditions for coherent theorizing.

### 2.2 From Logic to Structure: The Derivation Cascade

If 3FLL are constitutive, then coherent reality must exhibit structures that follow from logical coherence:

```
3FLL (primitive, self-grounding)
  ↓ presuppose
Domain of discourse (something exists to reason about)
  ↓ enforce
Binary distinctions (A or ¬A for any property)
  ↓ require
Distinguishability (coherent difference between states)
  ↓ constrain
Mathematical structures (those compatible with 3FLL)
  ↓ constrain
Physical structures (those instantiating coherent mathematics)
```

This cascade makes explicit what is usually implicit: the logical dependencies between layers of theoretical structure.

### 2.3 The Tier System: Making Assumptions Explicit

We propose a three-tier classification of theoretical inputs:

**Tier 1: Structural Assumptions for 3FLL Application**
- Domain of discourse (I - something exists)
- No arbitrary bound on distinguishability (I_infinite)
- These are substantive assumptions, not pure consequences of 3FLL
- LRT argues they are *required* for coherent application; this is part of the thesis

**Tier 2: Established Mathematical Reconstruction Results**
- Theorems like Stone's, Gleason's, Masanes-Müller reconstruction
- Each presupposes its own structural assumptions (Hilbert space, tomographic locality, etc.)
- Accepted for practical use; presuppositions tracked explicitly

**Tier 3: Physical Principles**
- Energy additivity, conservation laws, locality assumptions
- Distinguish: empirical regularities vs. symmetry consequences
- Accepted for practical use; status tracked

**Key insight:** Every Tier 2/3 input carries presuppositions that can be traced. Making this explicit prevents the conflation of "established result" with "assumption-free derivation."

## 3. Comparison with Existing Traditions

### 3.1 Logical Empiricism and the Structure of Theories

The logical empiricist tradition (Carnap, Hempel, Nagel) analyzed theories as:
- Theoretical terms + observational terms
- Correspondence rules connecting them
- Axioms organizing theoretical structure

**Where Logic Realism differs:**
- We treat 3FLL not as metatheoretical apparatus but as *constitutive of the subject matter*
- The correspondence problem dissolves: logical structure is not imposed on reality but is reality's coherence condition
- Axioms are not free choices but constrained derivations from coherence requirements

### 3.2 Underdetermination and Background Assumptions

Quine-Duhem underdetermination: empirical evidence alone cannot fix theory choice because auxiliary assumptions can always be adjusted.

**Logic Realism response:**
- 3FLL are not adjustable auxiliaries - they are preconditions for coherent theorizing
- The tier system makes explicit which assumptions *can* be varied (Tier 2/3 presuppositions) and which cannot (3FLL)
- This does not eliminate underdetermination but clarifies its scope: underdetermination operates within the space constrained by logical coherence

**Comparison with Friedman's "relativized a priori":**
- Friedman argues some principles function as constitutive for a theoretical framework
- We agree, but locate the truly invariant constitutive principles at 3FLL
- Higher-tier assumptions are constitutive for particular frameworks but not absolutely

### 3.3 Reconstruction Programs in Quantum Foundations

Recent work (Hardy, Chiribella et al., Masanes-Müller) reconstructs quantum theory from information-theoretic postulates:
- Start with operational axioms (tomographic locality, continuous reversibility, etc.)
- Derive Hilbert space structure as a theorem

**Logic Realism analysis:**
- These programs make *some* assumptions explicit (the operational axioms)
- But they typically do not ask: what grounds the operational axioms themselves?
- Our framework provides a place to locate this question: Are the operational axioms downstream of 3FLL?
- Current status: We accept reconstruction results as Tier 2 inputs, tracking their presuppositions

**Example presupposition tracking:**

| Reconstruction | Key Presuppositions | Status in LRT |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Masanes-Müller | Tomographic locality, subspace axiom | Tier 2 (derivability from 3FLL open) |
| Hardy (2001) | Continuous state space, simplicity | Tier 2 |
| Chiribella et al. | Purification, causality | Tier 2 |

### 3.4 "Assumptions of Physics" Projects

Wheeler's "it from bit," Rovelli's relational QM, and various "physics from information" programs share a logic-first intuition.

**Where Logic Realism differs:**
- We do not privilege "information" as primitive - information is *about* something (presupposes domain)
- We explicitly ground in 3FLL rather than taking "bit" as unexplained primitive
- We provide a systematic tier classification rather than ad hoc "this is fundamental"

## 4. Case Studies: The Methodology in Practice

### 4.1 Case Study 1: Deriving the Action Functional

**Traditional presentation:** The principle of least action S = ∫ L dt is a postulate. Its success justifies it empirically.

**Logic Realism analysis:**

*Derivation chain:*
```
3FLL → Binary distinctions → Distinguishability metric D
  → Minimum scale (ℏ defined, not empirical) [parsimony argument]
  → Continuity of D [parsimony argument]
  → Reversibility of D-preserving transformations [parsimony argument]
  → Inner product structure [Tier 2: Masanes-Müller reconstruction]
  → Phase space (x, p) [mathematical consequence]
  → Action S = ∫ p dx [counting Planck cells]
  → Lagrangian S = ∫ L dt [Legendre transform]
  → Least action δS = 0 [parsimony: minimize specification cost]
```

*What this reveals:*
- Steps 1-6 (3FLL through reversibility): Explicitly derived from 3FLL + parsimony
- Step 7 (inner product): Uses Tier 2 theorem - presuppositions acknowledged
- Steps 8-11: Mathematical consequences given prior structure

*Methodological value:* We can now ask precisely: Can the Tier 2 presuppositions be derived from 3FLL? This is a research question, not a gap hidden by "that's just how physics works."

### 4.2 Case Study 2: The Fine Structure Constant

**Traditional view:** α ≈ 1/137 is an unexplained empirical constant.

**Logic Realism analysis:**

*Derivation chain:*
```
3FLL → Distinguishability → Spatial embedding dimension d
  → d = 3 selected by: complexity (d ≥ 3) ∩ stability (d ≤ 3)
  → Information bits k = 2d + 1 = 7
  → Base capacity 2^7 = 128
  → Geometric embedding cost d² = 9
  → Self-interaction correction c/α⁻¹
  → α⁻¹ = 128 + 9 + correction = 137.036... (8 ppb accuracy)
```

*Status:*
- Dimension selection uses "stability" - arguably Tier 3 (physics input)
- Formula achieves 8 ppb agreement with CODATA
- Whether this is "derived" or "fitted" depends on the status of the stability argument

*Methodological value:* The tier system forces us to be precise about what is being claimed. We do not say "α is derived from pure logic" - we say "α emerges from this chain with these Tier 2/3 inputs."

## 5. Implications and Open Questions

### 5.1 For Philosophy of Science

1. **Reconceiving the analytic/synthetic distinction:** 3FLL are neither purely analytic (about meanings) nor synthetic (about the world) in the traditional sense. They are constitutive of coherent worldhood.

2. **Naturalism and logic:** If 3FLL are constitutive of reality, logic is not merely a human invention but a discovery of necessary structure. This has implications for the debate over logical pluralism.

3. **The status of mathematics:** Mathematics emerges as the study of structures compatible with 3FLL. This grounds mathematics in something more than convention but less than Platonism.

### 5.2 For Foundations of Physics

1. **Unification:** If diverse physical principles are downstream of 3FLL, apparent diversity may mask underlying unity. The tier system provides a framework for investigating this.

2. **Quantum gravity:** Spacetime structure itself may be constrained by 3FLL. This suggests a new angle on quantum gravity: what spacetime structures are logically coherent?

3. **Constants of nature:** Unexplained constants become research questions: what is their derivation chain? What tier inputs do they require?

### 5.3 Open Questions for the Logic Realism Program

1. **Completeness:** Can all Tier 2/3 inputs eventually be derived from 3FLL? This is the strong version of the thesis.

2. **Uniqueness:** Does 3FLL + parsimony uniquely determine physics, or are there multiple coherent realizations?

3. **The status of parsimony:** We frequently invoke parsimony (minimize specification cost). Is this derived from 3FLL or an additional assumption?

---

## 6. Conclusion

The Logic Realism Thesis proposes that 3FLL function as constitutive constraints on coherent reality, not merely on valid reasoning. This generates a methodology - the tiered analysis of theoretical assumptions - that makes explicit what is usually hidden in foundational work.

We do not claim to have proven that all physics derives from pure logic. We claim that:
1. Framing 3FLL as constitutive provides a coherent research program
2. The tier system clarifies assumption dependencies in existing theories
3. Concrete derivation chains demonstrate the methodology's value
4. Open questions are precisely locatable within the framework

The Logic Realism approach does not compete with physics but provides a meta-framework for analyzing what physics presupposes and what it achieves.
