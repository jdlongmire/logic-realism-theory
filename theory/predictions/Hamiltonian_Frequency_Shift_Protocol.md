**Prediction Path**: Path 5 - State-Dependent Hamiltonian Energy (Gemini Contribution)
**Status**: Protocol Outline with Quantitative Predictions
**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Version**: 1.1 (Quantitative Predictions Added)
**Previous Versions**:
- v1.0 (October 27, 2025): Initial protocol outline
- v1.1 (October 27, 2025): Quantitative predictions from first principles

## Executive Summary

This protocol outline describes an experimental test of Logic Realism Theory (LRT) using Ramsey interferometry to detect state-dependent frequency shifts. The test compares the Hamiltonian energy (frequency) of superposition states versus classical states to determine if superposition represents a different logical status with measurable energetic consequences.

**Key Hypothesis**:
- **LRT Prediction**: ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩) with **δω/ω ≈ 10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³** (0.01-0.1% frequency shift)
  - Derived from entropy-energy coupling: ΔE = α * k_B T ln(2)
  - Predicted magnitude: δω ≈ 100 kHz - 10 MHz (at T = 15 mK, α = 0.01-1.0)
  - Temperature-dependent signature: δω ∝ T
  - See `Quantitative_Predictions_Derivation.md` Section 3 for full derivation
- **QM Prediction**: ω(|+⟩) = ω(|0⟩) - Energy is state-independent in standard Hamiltonian framework

**Why This Test**:
- Complementary to Path 3 (probes energy instead of decay rates)
- Very high precision achievable (~kHz level with Ramsey interferometry)
- Uses validated Ramsey methodology from Path 1
- Standard metrology technique (well-characterized)
- Clear prediction difference between theories

**Key Advantage Over Path 3**:
- **Higher potential precision**: Ramsey frequency measurements can achieve 0.01-0.1% precision (vs 1-2% for T1/T2)
- **Direct energy probe**: Measures fundamental property (Hamiltonian) rather than derived quantity (decay)
- **Distinct signature**: Temperature dependence (δω ∝ T) distinguishes from AC Stark shift
- **Predicted effect size**: δω/ω ≈ 10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³ well within Ramsey precision

**Resource Requirements** (Estimated):
- ~500,000 total shots (250K per state × 2 states)
- ~3-4 hours quantum time per backend
- Enhanced IBM Quantum access (Researchers/Educators Program)
- 2-3 backends recommended for cross-validation

**Strategic Context**: This is an **unfunded research protocol** documenting testable predictions for future funded work.

## Theoretical Foundation

### LRT Hypothesis

**Core Framework**: Physical states emerge from logical filtering via three constraints (I, NC, EM). The Hamiltonian operator H, which generates time evolution, emerges from the **Identity constraint** (information persistence over time).

**Argument for State-Dependent Hamiltonian**:

1. **Classical State** (|0⟩ or |1⟩):
   - All three constraints active: I + NC + EM
   - Fully specified logically
   - Hamiltonian H₀ emerges from complete constraint application
   - Frequency: ω₀ = ⟨0|H|0⟩/ℏ

2. **Superposition State** (|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2):
   - Only I + NC active, **EM relaxed**
   - Incomplete specification (superposition of alternatives)
   - Hamiltonian H₊ emerges from partial constraint application
   - Frequency: ω₊ = ⟨+|H|+⟩/ℏ

3. **Key Question**: If EM constraint is relaxed for superposition, does this affect the emergent Hamiltonian?

**LRT Prediction**:
- ω₊ ≠ ω₀ (frequency shift due to logical status difference)
- Magnitude: δω = ω₊ - ω₀ ≠ 0
- **Quantitative prediction needed**: From LRT axioms, derive expected δω/ω₀

**Physical Interpretation**:
- Superposition "costs" different logical resources to maintain
- This cost manifests as modified energy (frequency)
- Observable as systematic frequency shift in Ramsey experiments

### Standard QM Prediction

**Hamiltonian is State-Independent**:
- In standard QM, H is an operator independent of state
- All states evolve under the same Hamiltonian H
- Frequency ω = ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩/ℏ depends only on energy eigenvalues, not logical status
- For single-qubit: ω(|0⟩) = ω(|1⟩) = ω₀ (qubit frequency)
- For superposition: ω(|+⟩) = (ω(|0⟩) + ω(|1⟩))/2 = ω₀

**Expected Measurement**:
- No frequency difference between |0⟩ and |+⟩ preparations
- Any observed shifts attributed to experimental imperfections:
  - AC Stark shifts from drive pulses
  - State preparation errors
  - Measurement-induced shifts
  - Calibration drifts

**Key Distinction**: LRT predicts systematic ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩), QM predicts ω(|+⟩) = ω(|0⟩) (any deviations are experimental artifacts, not fundamental physics).

## Experimental Design

### Measurement Strategy

Use Ramsey interferometry (same as Path 1 T2 measurement) but analyze **frequency** instead of **decay rate**.

**Experiment A: Reference Frequency** (Classical State |0⟩)
1. Initialize near |0⟩ (ground state)
2. Apply first π/2 pulse (Hadamard): |0⟩ → |+⟩
3. Free evolution for time T (no drive)
4. Apply second π/2 pulse (analysis): |+⟩ → |0⟩ or |1⟩
5. Measure: P(1|T)
6. Sweep T from 1-500 µs, observe oscillations
7. **Fit oscillations**: P(1|T) = 0.5 + A·exp(-T/T2)·cos(2π·ω₀·T + φ)
8. Extract reference frequency: ω₀

**Experiment B: Test Frequency** (Superposition State |+⟩)
1. Initialize near |+⟩ (superposition) via π/2 pulse from |0⟩
2. Free evolution for time T (maintain |+⟩ during evolution)
3. Apply analysis π/2 pulse
4. Measure: P(1|T)
5. Sweep T, observe oscillations
6. **Fit oscillations**: P(1|T) = 0.5 + A·exp(-T/T2)·cos(2π·ω₊·T + φ)
7. Extract test frequency: ω₊

**Analysis**:
- Compute frequency difference: **δω = ω₊ - ω₀**
- **LRT Prediction**: δω ≠ 0 (frequency shift due to logical status)
- **QM Prediction**: δω = 0 (no fundamental frequency shift)

**Statistical Test**:
- Null hypothesis H₀: δω = 0 (QM)
- Alternative H₁: δω ≠ 0 (LRT) - two-tailed test
- Significance: p < 0.05
- Effect size: |δω|/ω₀ (fractional shift)

### Circuit Specifications

**Circuit A: Reference (|0⟩ preparation)**
```
Circuit: |0⟩ → H → delay(T) → H → Measure
         [prepare |+⟩] [evolve] [analyze] [readout]
```
- Initial state: |0⟩ (ground)
- H gate: Creates |+⟩ superposition
- Delay: Free evolution under H for time T
- H gate: Analysis pulse (projects onto |0⟩/|1⟩ basis)
- Measure: Record outcome

**Circuit B: Test (|+⟩ preparation)**
```
Circuit: |0⟩ → H → [no delay] → delay(T) → H → Measure
         [prepare |+⟩]           [evolve]    [analyze]
```
- Initial state: |0⟩ → H → |+⟩
- Key: Ensure |+⟩ is prepared identically to Circuit A's intermediate state
- Delay: Free evolution under H for time T
- H gate: Analysis pulse
- Measure: Record outcome

**Alternative Design** (Avoids Preparation Ambiguity):
- Use **detuned** Ramsey for Circuit A (add artificial detuning δ)
- Use **on-resonance** Ramsey for Circuit B
- Measure if observed frequencies differ by more than δ

**Critical Implementation Detail**: Circuits A and B must differ ONLY in the logical state being probed, not in pulse sequences. Ensuring this may be challenging and requires careful calibration.

### Duration Sweep

**Sampling Strategy** (from Path 1 validation):
- **Short times** (1-100 µs): Log-spaced, 25 points
  - High-resolution near origin where oscillations are clear
- **Long times** (100-500 µs): Linear-spaced, 25 points
  - Captures decay envelope and long-term behavior
- **Total**: 50 duration points per circuit

**Shot Count**: 10,000 shots per point
- Rationale: ~0.5% measurement precision per point
- Target: Detect 0.1% frequency shift with 95% confidence
- Total shots per circuit: 50 × 10,000 = 500,000
- Total shots per backend: 1,000,000 (both circuits)

## Statistical Analysis

### Frequency Extraction

**Method 1: Sinusoidal Fit**

For each circuit, fit Ramsey oscillations to:
```
P(1|T) = 0.5 + A·exp(-T/T2)·cos(2π·ω·T + φ) + p0
```

Parameters:
- ω: Oscillation frequency (target measurement)
- T2: Coherence time (controls decay envelope)
- A: Oscillation amplitude (≤0.5)
- φ: Phase offset
- p0: Baseline error rate

**Fit quality**: Require R² > 0.95 for valid measurement

**Method 2: Fourier Transform**

Alternative: FFT of time-domain data to extract dominant frequency
- Advantage: Model-independent
- Disadvantage: Lower precision, sensitive to windowing

**Recommendation**: Use Method 1 (sinusoidal fit) as primary, Method 2 for cross-check

### Error Propagation

**Frequency uncertainties**:
- σ(ω₀): Standard error from fit to Circuit A data
- σ(ω₊): Standard error from fit to Circuit B data

**Frequency difference uncertainty**:
```
σ(δω) = sqrt(σ(ω₀)² + σ(ω₊)²)
```

**Fractional shift uncertainty**:
```
σ(δω/ω₀) = (δω/ω₀) · sqrt((σ(δω)/δω)² + (σ(ω₀)/ω₀)²)
```

### Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (QM)**: H₀: δω = 0

**Test Statistic**:
```
t = δω / σ(δω)
```

**Degrees of Freedom**: df = 2×50 - 2 = 98 (two fits, 50 points each)

**p-value**: Two-tailed t-test

**Decision Criterion**:
- p < 0.05 → Reject H₀, evidence for LRT (frequency shift detected)
- p ≥ 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀, consistent with QM (no shift)

**Effect Size (Cohen's d)**:
```
d = δω / sqrt((σ(ω₀)² + σ(ω₊)²)/2)
```

### Expected Precision

**Typical Ramsey Frequency Precision**:
- Qubit frequency: ω₀ ~= 5 GHz
- With 10,000 shots per point, 50 points: σ(ω) ~= 1-10 kHz
- Fractional precision: σ(ω)/ω ~= 0.01-0.1%

**Minimum Detectable Shift** (95% confidence, 95% power):
- δω_min ~= 3 × σ(δω) ~= 3-30 kHz
- Fractional: δω_min/ω₀ ~= 0.01-0.1%

**Comparison to Path 3**:
- Path 3 (T1 vs T2): Detects ~10% difference
- Path 5 (frequency): Detects ~0.01-0.1% difference
- **Path 5 is 100-1000× more sensitive** (if effect exists at this level)

## Confound Analysis

### Primary Confounds

**1. AC Stark Shift (State-Dependent)**

**Issue**: Drive pulses (H gates) can shift qubit frequency depending on state population

**Mechanism**:
- Off-resonance components of drive pulse create AC Stark effect
- Shift magnitude depends on state: ΔωStark(|0⟩) ≠ ΔωStark(|+⟩)
- Could mimic LRT frequency shift

**Mitigation**:
- Calibrate drive pulses to minimize off-resonance components
- Measure AC Stark shift independently (vary drive power, measure frequency)
- Subtract known Stark contribution from observed δω
- **Residual shift after correction** is candidate for LRT effect

**Distinguishing LRT from AC Stark** (Temperature-Dependence Test):
- **LRT signature**: δω ∝ T (frequency shift scales linearly with temperature)
  - From derivation: δω = (α * k_B T ln(2))/ℏ
  - Predicted slope: dδω/dT = (α * k_B ln(2))/ℏ ≈ 90 kHz/mK (for α = 0.1)
- **AC Stark signature**: δω independent of T (drive pulse power constant)
- **Protocol**: Sweep T from 10 mK to 100 mK (10× range), measure δω(T)
- **Fit**: δω(T) = slope * T + offset
  - LRT: slope > 0 (linear T-dependence)
  - AC Stark: slope ≈ 0 (T-independent offset only)
- **Advantage**: Unambiguous signature - AC Stark cannot mimic linear T-dependence

**2. State Preparation Fidelity**

**Issue**: Different fidelities for |0⟩ vs |+⟩ preparation could bias frequency measurement

**Mechanism**:
- If |+⟩ preparation has lower fidelity → mixed state → different observed frequency
- Preparation errors introduce systematic bias

**Mitigation**:
- Verify preparation fidelity via state tomography
- Require F(|0⟩) > 99% and F(|+⟩) > 98%
- Model effect of imperfect preparation on frequency extraction
- Correct for known fidelity differences

**3. Frequency Drift Over Time**

**Issue**: Hardware frequency drifts between Circuit A and Circuit B measurements

**Mechanism**:
- Qubit frequency ω₀ drifts ~kHz/hour due to flux noise, temperature
- If measurements separated by hours → apparent frequency difference

**Mitigation**:
- **Interleave** Circuit A and Circuit B measurements (alternate every few shots)
- Measure temporal drift explicitly (repeat reference measurements)
- Subtract linear drift trend from data
- Require measurements within <1 hour

**4. Measurement-Induced Frequency Shifts**

**Issue**: Readout resonator coupling can shift qubit frequency state-dependently

**Mechanism**:
- Dispersive readout: Resonator frequency depends on qubit state
- Back-action: Resonator shifts qubit frequency
- Effect: ω_observed ≠ ω_intrinsic

**Mitigation**:
- Characterize dispersive shift via Ramsey spectroscopy
- Use low-power readout to minimize back-action
- Model and subtract known measurement-induced shifts

**5. Calibration Errors**

**Issue**: Imperfect knowledge of π/2 pulse angles introduces systematic errors

**Mechanism**:
- If π/2 pulse is actually (π/2 + ε) → frequency extraction biased
- Different pulse errors for |0⟩ vs |+⟩ could create apparent frequency difference

**Mitigation**:
- Calibrate pulse angles to <1% accuracy via Rabi oscillations
- Verify calibration independently for both circuits
- Model effect of pulse errors on frequency measurement
- Correct for known calibration imperfections

### Secondary Confounds

- **Crosstalk**: Minimal (single-qubit measurement)
- **Decoherence**: Affects amplitude, not frequency (T2 extracted separately)
- **Shot noise**: Statistical (included in error bars)

### Confound Hierarchy (Severity)

1. **Critical**: AC Stark shift, State preparation fidelity
2. **Important**: Frequency drift, Measurement-induced shifts
3. **Moderate**: Calibration errors
4. **Minor**: Crosstalk, shot noise

**Assessment**: Path 5 has **more confounds** than Path 3 (which primarily has drift + pure dephasing). AC Stark shift in particular is a major challenge requiring careful characterization.

## Resource Requirements

### Quantum Time Estimate

**Per Backend**:
- Circuit A (reference): 50 points × 10,000 shots = 500,000 shots
- Circuit B (test): 50 points × 10,000 shots = 500,000 shots
- Calibration overhead: ~10% (pulse calibration, state tomography)
- Total shots: ~1.1M per backend
- **Quantum time**: ~3-4 hours per backend (including queue wait)

**For 3-Backend Cross-Validation**:
- Total quantum time: ~10-12 hours
- Total shots: ~3.3M across all backends

**Comparison to Path 3**:
- Path 3: ~120 hours (3 backends × 40 hours)
- Path 5: ~10-12 hours (3 backends × 3-4 hours)
- **Path 5 is ~10× faster** (fewer duration points, no T2echo measurement)

### Access Requirements

**IBM Quantum Access Tier**: Enhanced (Researchers/Educators Program)
- Justification: >1M shots, extended measurement campaigns
- Application: Research proposal citing Path 1 validation + Path 3 protocol
- Alternative: Cloud credits (~$1,000-1,500 if purchasing)

**Backend Selection**:
- Require: Single-qubit T2 > 100 µs (for clean Ramsey oscillations)
- Prefer: Low-frequency drift (<10 kHz/hour)
- Examples: ibm_sherbrooke, ibm_torino, ibm_kyoto

### Personnel Requirements

**Implementation** (~1-2 weeks):

**Total**: ~3-4 weeks (implementation + analysis + confound assessment)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Compared to Path 3**:
- Path 3: MEDIUM (straightforward measurements, few confounds)
- Path 5: MEDIUM-HIGH (higher precision needed, more confounds)

**Key Risks**:
1. AC Stark shift dominates signal (requires precise calibration)
2. State preparation fidelity insufficient (<98%)
3. Frequency drift faster than measurement speed
4. Observed shift within systematic error budget (inconclusive)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Extensive calibration before main experiment
- Interleaved measurements to control drift
- Model all known confounds and subtract
- Cross-validate on multiple backends

## Implementation Notes

### Comparison to Path 3 (T1 vs T2 Test)

| Aspect | Path 3 (T1 vs T2) | Path 5 (Frequency) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Observable** | Decay rates (T1, T2) | Frequencies (ω₀, ω₊) |
| **Precision** | 1-2% (typical) | 0.01-0.1% (Ramsey metrology) |
| **Confounds** | Few (drift, pure dephasing) | More (Stark, calibration, prep fidelity) |
| **Quantum time** | ~120 hours (3 backends) | ~10-12 hours (3 backends) |
| **Implementation** | Standard (T1/T2 protocols) | Standard (Ramsey protocol) |
| **Analysis** | Moderate (two exponentials) | Moderate (sinusoidal fits) |
| **Risk** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM-HIGH |

**Strategic Assessment**:
- **Path 3 is simpler and more robust** (fewer confounds)
- **Path 5 offers higher potential precision** (if confounds controlled)
- **Recommendation**: Start with Path 3, pursue Path 5 if Path 3 shows LRT ≈ QM (need higher sensitivity)

### Relation to Path 1 (T2 Baseline)

**Path 1 (Completed)**:
- Measured T2 = 211.59 ± 18.44 µs on ibm_torino
- No LRT signal detected at 2.8% precision
- Validated Ramsey methodology

**Path 5 (This Protocol)**:
- Uses same Ramsey circuit as Path 1
- Analyzes **frequency** instead of **decay rate**
- Leverages Path 1 validation (methodology proven to work)

**Advantage**: Path 5 builds on proven infrastructure (no new technique development needed)

### Pilot Test Recommendation

**Before full execution, run pilot**:
- 1 backend, 10 duration points, 1,000 shots per point
- Goal: Technical validation only (not scientific)
- Check: Do frequency fits converge? Is precision ~kHz?
- Assess: Are confounds manageable? Is drift acceptable?
- Duration: ~30 minutes quantum time
- Cost: Free tier (10,000 shots << monthly limit)

**Decision**: Proceed with full experiment only if pilot shows:
- Frequency extraction precision σ(ω) < 10 kHz
- AC Stark shift < 50 kHz (correctable)
- Drift < 10 kHz/hour (manageable)

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Frequency Shift Detected (δω ≠ 0, p < 0.05)

**Interpretation**:
- **If δω > 50 kHz** (fractional shift >0.001%): Strong evidence for LRT
- Requires: Verification on multiple backends
- Requires: Rigorous confound analysis (AC Stark, prep fidelity)
- Requires: Independent replication

**Next Steps**:
- Rule out all QM explanations (Stark, calibration, etc.)
- If robust → Major physics result (new state-dependent effect)
- Publication: High-impact journal (PRL, Nature Physics)

**Caution**: High precision cuts both ways - more sensitive to confounds

### Scenario 2: No Frequency Shift (δω ≈ 0, p > 0.05)

**Interpretation**:
- Consistent with QM (no state-dependent Hamiltonian)
- Either: LRT = QM for this observable
- Or: LRT effect < 0.01% (below detection threshold)

**Next Steps**:
- Document null result honestly
- Compare to Path 3 (if also null → LRT likely equivalent to QM)
- Consider: LRT may be correct interpretation but make same predictions

**Scientific Value**: Rules out large LRT frequency shifts (important constraint)

### Scenario 3: Inconclusive (Confounds Dominate)

**Interpretation**:
- AC Stark shift or other confounds too large to isolate LRT signal
- Systematic errors exceed statistical precision
- Cannot distinguish δω_LRT from δω_systematics

**Next Steps**:
- Improve calibration (more precise AC Stark characterization)
- Increase shot count (reduce statistical error)
- Alternative: Try different observable (Path 3, Path 8)

**Lesson**: Path 5 is high-risk, high-reward (confounds are challenging)

---

## Comparison to Other Prediction Paths

### Path 3 (T1 vs T2) - Complementary

**Similarities**:
- Both test state-dependent properties (decay vs energy)
- Both use standard protocols (T1/T2 vs Ramsey)
- Both require enhanced access

**Differences**:
- Path 3: Lower precision (1-2%), fewer confounds, more robust
- Path 5: Higher precision (0.01-0.1%), more confounds, higher risk

**Strategic Relationship**:
- If Path 3 shows T2 < T1 → Path 5 provides independent confirmation
- If Path 3 shows T2 ≈ T1 → Path 5 tests if effect exists at higher precision
- **Ideal**: Run both, compare results for consistency

### Path 1 (T2 Baseline) - Foundation

**Path 1 Result**: No LRT signal in absolute T2 at 2.8% precision

**Implication for Path 5**:
- If LRT frequency shift exists, it's either:
  - Small (<2.8% of qubit frequency → <150 MHz)
  - Or affects T2 and frequency differently
- Path 5 can detect much smaller effects (0.01% → 500 kHz)

**Consistency Check**:
- Path 1: T2(LRT) ≈ T2(QM) at 2.8%
- Path 5: ω(LRT) ≠ ω(QM) at 0.01%?
- If Path 5 detects shift, must explain why Path 1 didn't

### Path 8 (QC Upper Limits) - Long-Term

**Path 8**: Tests for fundamental QC limits (error floor, max qubits, etc.)

**Relation to Path 5**:
- If Path 5 detects state-dependent Hamiltonian → Could explain QC limits
- Example: Superposition "costs" more energy → limits entanglement scaling
- Path 5 provides microscopic mechanism for Path 8 macro limits

**Timeline**:
- Path 5: Testable now (2-3 months)
- Path 8: Testable in 5-10 years (as QC advances)

---

## Theoretical Questions Requiring Clarification

**1. Quantitative LRT Prediction**:
- Current: "ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩)" (qualitative)
- Needed: "δω/ω₀ ≈ X ± Y" (quantitative)
- Question: Can LRT derive expected frequency shift magnitude from axioms?

**2. Mechanism for Frequency Shift**:
- How does relaxed EM constraint affect Hamiltonian H?
- Is this a fundamental modification to H, or an effective shift?
- Does it apply to all superpositions, or only specific ones?

**3. Relation to T1/T2**:
- If ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩), what does this imply for T1 vs T2?
- Are frequency shift and stability (T1/T2) coupled or independent?
- Can LRT predict both consistently?

**4. Scaling with System Size**:
- Does δω depend on qubit count N?
- What about multi-qubit entangled states?
- Implications for QC limits (Path 8)?

**Recommendation**: Develop theoretical framework for Path 5 predictions before pursuing experimentally. Need quantitative, testable prediction, not just qualitative hypothesis.
