# Hardware Test Report: Logic Realism Theory on IBM Quantum

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Backend**: IBM ibm_torino (133-qubit processor)
**Job ID**: d3v1jks60rgc73acmtug
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

This report documents a **small-scale proof-of-concept test** of Logic Realism Theory (LRT) on real quantum hardware - the first attempt to experimentally validate LRT predictions using IBM's quantum processors. We executed a Ramsey decoherence experiment on IBM's ibm_torino, collecting 62,500 measurements across 25 duration points to search for deviations from standard quantum mechanics (QM) predictions.

**Scope**: This is a preliminary test with limited statistical power (2,500 shots per point, ~2.8% noise level) designed to validate methodology and establish baseline measurements. **This is not a definitive test of LRT.**

**Result**: No LRT signal detected. Hardware data is consistent with standard quantum mechanical predictions within measurement uncertainty.

## Experimental Design

### Test Type
Ramsey decoherence experiment - measures T2 coherence time by detecting phase errors accumulated during free evolution.

### Circuit Structure
```
|0⟩ ── H ── delay(T) ── H ── Measure
```

### Parameters
- **Total Shots**: 62,500 (25 duration points × 2,500 shots each)
- **Duration Range**: 1-500 microseconds (µs)
- **Sampling**: Log-linear sweep (dense at short times, sparse at long times)
- **Quantum Time Used**: ~5-7 minutes
- **Queue Wait**: ~30 seconds
- **Execution Time**: ~30 seconds

### Duration Sweep Design
- **1-100 µs**: 13 points (logarithmic spacing) - captures early decoherence
- **100-500 µs**: 12 points (linear spacing) - captures approach to complete decoherence

## Hardware Performance

### IBM ibm_torino Specifications
- **Qubits**: 133 total
- **Qubit Used**: Qubit 0 (lowest-error qubit, initial layout optimization)
- **Queue Status**: 413 pending jobs at submission time
- **Instance**: LFT-1.0 (Logic Field Theory - 10 minutes available)

### Measured Coherence Properties
- **T2 (Coherence Time)**: 211.59 ± 18.44 µs
- **Baseline Error (p0)**: 9.29% ± 1.04%

**Note**: T2 = 211.59 µs is approximately 2× longer than the initial estimate (100 µs), indicating better-than-expected hardware performance for this qubit.

## Results

### Raw Data Summary

| Duration Range | Error Rate Range | Interpretation |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1-7 µs         | 10.16-10.96%     | Short-time baseline (gate + measurement errors) |
| 10-68 µs       | 13.00-24.20%     | Active decoherence phase |
| 100-500 µs     | 29.28-49.36%     | Approaching complete decoherence (50% = random) |

### QM Baseline Fit

**Model**: Standard quantum mechanics prediction for Ramsey experiment
```
p_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + p0
```

**Fit Quality**:
- **R² = 0.9689** (96.89% of variance explained)
- **Rating**: GOOD fit
- **Residual RMS**: 2.84%

### Statistical Analysis

#### Residual Statistics
- **Mean**: 0.0000% (perfectly centered - no systematic bias)
- **Std Dev**: 2.90%
- **Range**: -8.82% to +3.50%

#### Hypothesis Tests

| Test | Purpose | p-value | Result |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Mean Residual | Systematic deviation from QM? | 1.0000 | **PASS** - No deviation |
| Shapiro-Wilk | Are residuals normally distributed? | 0.0005 | **FAIL** - Non-normal |
| Runs Test | Random or patterned residuals? | 0.0249 | **FAIL** - Pattern detected |

---

## Interpretation

### LRT Signal Detection
**Conclusion**: **NO LRT SIGNAL DETECTED**

The mean residual test (p = 1.0000) shows no evidence for systematic deviations from quantum mechanical predictions. The hardware data is fully consistent with standard QM at the current level of measurement precision (~2.8% RMS noise).

### Non-Normal Residuals
The Shapiro-Wilk test (p = 0.0005) and Runs test (p = 0.0249) indicate:
- Residuals are not perfectly normally distributed
- There is some time-dependent structure in the noise

**Interpretation**: This suggests the simple exponential T2 model doesn't capture all hardware behavior. Possible causes:
1. **1/f noise** - Low-frequency noise common in superconducting qubits
2. **T1 contribution** - Amplitude damping (not included in pure T2 model)
3. **Multi-exponential decay** - Multiple decoherence channels with different timescales
4. **Drift** - Slow hardware parameter changes during measurement

**Important**: These effects are **known features of real quantum hardware**, not evidence for new physics.

### Why No LRT Signal?

Three possible explanations:

1. **LRT = QM** (Likely): Logic Realism Theory may be mathematically equivalent to standard QM, making it a reinterpretation rather than a distinct prediction.

2. **Signal Too Small** (Possible): LRT deviations may exist but be smaller than our measurement precision (~2.8% RMS).

3. **Wrong Observable** (Possible): T2 decoherence may not be sensitive to LRT effects. Other observables might show signals.

## Technical Details

### Data Extraction Bug (Fixed)
**Issue**: Initial extraction returned all zeros because counts dictionary uses string keys `'0'`, `'1'` instead of integer keys `0`, `1`.

**Fix**: Changed `counts.get(0, 0)` to `counts.get('0', 0)` in extraction code.

**Lesson**: Always inspect result structure carefully when using new Qiskit versions (SamplerV2 API changed from previous versions).

### API Issues Resolved
1. **Channel parameter**: Changed `"ibm_quantum"` → `"ibm_quantum_platform"`
2. **Session not supported**: Open plan doesn't allow Sessions, used job mode instead
3. **Instance required**: Added CRN-based instance specification for LFT-1.0 plan

## Comparison to Simulation (Phase 3)

| Metric | Phase 3 (Simulation) | Hardware Test | Match? |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| Data Points | 49 | 25 | Similar |
| Total Shots | 10,000 per point | 2,500 per point | 4× less |
| VIF | 1.0 | 1.0 | ✓ Exact |
| R² | 0.9996 | 0.9689 | Good |
| Residual RMS | ~0.5% | 2.84% | Higher (real noise) |
| LRT Signal | Not tested | Not detected | Consistent |

**Interpretation**: Phase 3 validation was successful - the methodology works. Hardware shows higher noise (as expected for real qubits) but the analysis framework is robust.

---

## Recommendations

### For Future LRT Tests

1. **Increase Shot Count**: Use 10,000+ shots per point to reduce statistical noise from 2.8% to <1%.

2. **Test Multiple Observables**:
   - Rabi oscillations
   - Spin echo (T2 vs T2*)
   - Multi-qubit entanglement measures
   - Bell inequality violations with varying decoherence

3. **Higher-Quality Qubits**: Use premium backends (e.g., IBM Quantum Heron) with lower error rates.

4. **Controlled Comparison**: Run identical circuits on multiple backends to separate hardware effects from potential LRT signals.

5. **Model Refinement**: Include T1, 1/f noise, and multi-exponential decay in baseline model to reduce non-normal residuals.

### For Theoretical Development

1. **Make Testable Predictions**: If LRT ≠ QM, identify specific observables where predictions differ quantitatively.

2. **Estimate Effect Size**: Calculate expected deviation magnitude to determine required measurement precision.

3. **Alternative Tests**: If decoherence is QM-like, look for LRT signatures in:
   - Thermalization dynamics
   - Quantum-to-classical transitions
   - Information scrambling rates

## Limitations of This Proof-of-Concept

### What This Test Was

✓ **Proof-of-Concept**: Validated that hardware testing of LRT is feasible
✓ **Methodology Validation**: Confirmed Phase 3 simulation accurately predicted workflow
✓ **Baseline Measurement**: Established noise floor and required precision for future tests
✓ **Technical Demonstration**: Successfully used IBM Quantum platform for LRT testing

### What This Test Was NOT

✗ **Definitive LRT Test**: Limited statistical power (2,500 shots vs 10,000+ needed)
✗ **Comprehensive**: Single observable (T2), single backend, single run
✗ **High Precision**: 2.8% RMS noise vs <1% needed to detect small effects
✗ **Theory Validation**: Cannot definitively rule out LRT deviations

### Key Limitations

1. **Statistical Power**:
   - **This Test**: 62,500 total shots (25 points × 2,500 shots)
   - **Phase 3 Validated Design**: ~1,000,000 total shots (49 points × 10,000 shots × 2 experiments)
   - **Scaling Factor**: This test used only **6.25%** of the validated shot count
   - **Precision Achieved**: 2.8% RMS noise
   - **Precision Needed**: <1% RMS for detecting 0.5% LRT deviations

2. **Single Backend**: Hardware-specific effects not controlled. Need measurements on multiple backends for comparison.

3. **Single Observable**: Tested only T2 decoherence. LRT might show signals in other observables (entanglement, thermalization, etc.).

4. **Single Run**: No repeated measurements to control for drift and validate reproducibility.

5. **Free Tier Constraints**:
   - Limited to 10 minutes quantum time on IBM Quantum Open Plan
   - Full validated design would require ~100-150 minutes of quantum time
   - This test used ~7 minutes (7% of free tier monthly allocation)
   - Full test would require **enhanced access** (Researchers/Educators Program)

### What We Can Conclude

**Conservative Claim**: At 2.8% measurement precision, no LRT deviation from QM was detected in T2 decoherence on one IBM qubit.

**Cannot Claim**: "LRT has been experimentally ruled out" or "LRT equals QM" - the test was not comprehensive enough for such conclusions.

## Conclusions

This hardware test represents a **proof-of-concept milestone for Logic Realism Theory** - the first experimental investigation on real quantum hardware. While no LRT signal was detected, the test was scientifically successful:

✓ **Methodology Validated**: Phase 3 simulation accurately predicted analysis workflow
