# Path 3 Experimental Protocol: T1 vs T2 Comparison Test

**Prediction Path**: Path 3 - Logical State-Dependent Error (Gemini Idea 1)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This protocol describes a comprehensive experimental test of Logic Realism Theory (LRT) using standard quantum relaxation measurements to detect state-dependent decoherence. The test compares amplitude relaxation time (T1) with phase coherence time (T2) to determine if superposition states are fundamentally less stable than classical states.

**Key Hypothesis**:
- **LRT Prediction**: T2 < T1 (superposition decays faster due to relaxed logical constraints)
- **QM Prediction**: T2 ≈ T1 (no fundamental preference between state types)

**Why This Test**:
- Clear prediction difference between theories
- Standard, well-characterized measurements
- Avoids multicollinearity (single circuit type for each measurement)
- Few confounds (primarily hardware drift)
- Ready to implement with validated methodology from Path 1

**Resource Requirements**:
- ~1,000,000 total shots (500K for T1 + 500K for T2)
- ~4-6 hours quantum time per backend
- Enhanced IBM Quantum access (Researchers/Educators Program)
- 3 backends recommended for cross-validation

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-4 weeks (including queue wait, multiple runs, analysis)

## Theoretical Foundation

### LRT Hypothesis

**Core Claim**: Physical states emerge from logical filtering of information space using three fundamental constraints:
1. **Identity (I)**: Information persists over time
2. **Non-Contradiction (NC)**: No contradictory information
3. **Excluded Middle (EM)**: Complete specification

**Classical State** (e.g., |0⟩ or |1⟩):
- All three constraints active: I + NC + EM
- Fully specified, logically stable
- Amplitude relaxation (T1) represents constraint application cost

**Superposition State** (e.g., |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2):
- Only I + NC active, **EM relaxed**
- Incomplete specification, "logically unstable"
- Phase coherence (T2) affected by this instability

**Prediction**: The relaxed logical constraint in superposition states causes:
- **T2 < T1**: Phase coherence decays faster than amplitude
- **Measurable ratio**: T2/T1 < 1 - δ, where δ > 0 is LRT deviation

### Standard QM Prediction

**No State Preference**:
- Both T1 (amplitude damping) and T2 (phase damping) arise from environment coupling
- No fundamental reason for superposition to be less stable
- Pure dephasing: T2* ≤ T2 ≤ 2·T1 (well-known bound)
- For pure dephasing without relaxation: **T2 = T1 exactly**

**Typical Real Hardware**:
- T2 < 2·T1 due to additional pure dephasing (noise, fluctuations)
- But QM predicts no systematic T2 << T1 effect
- Ratio T2/T1 typically ~0.5-2.0 depending on noise sources

**Key Distinction**: LRT predicts systematic preference (T2 always < T1 due to logical status), QM predicts no such preference (ratios vary by noise environment, not state type).

## Experimental Design Overview

### Measurement Strategy

We will perform two independent, standard relaxation measurements on the same qubit:

**Experiment A: T1 Measurement** (Amplitude Relaxation)
- Prepare |1⟩ (excited state)
- Wait time T
- Measure population decay |1⟩ → |0⟩
- Fit: P_1(T) = exp(-T/T1)

**Experiment B: T2 Measurement** (Phase Coherence)
- Prepare |+⟩ (superposition)
- Wait time T
- Measure phase coherence loss
- Fit: P_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2))

**Analysis**: Compare T1 vs T2
- Compute ratio: R = T2/T1
- **LRT Prediction**: R < 0.9 (superposition less stable by >10%)
- **QM Prediction**: R ≈ 1.0 ± 0.2 (no systematic preference)

### Why This Design Avoids Previous Issues

**Path 2 Problem** (Contradiction test): A/B circuit comparison introduced logical equivalence
**Path 3 Solution**: Both T1 and T2 use standard, independent protocols - no direct circuit comparison

**Multicollinearity**: Not an issue
- T1: Single time parameter T, single circuit type
- T2: Single time parameter T, single circuit type (different from T1)
- VIF = 1.0 for each measurement

**Distinguishability**: Clear
- LRT and QM make different predictions for the ratio T2/T1
- Not asking "does effect X happen?" (both might predict X)
- Asking "which decays faster?" (theories differ)

## Detailed Circuit Specifications

### T1 Measurement Circuit

**Purpose**: Measure amplitude relaxation time (energy decay)

**Circuit**:
```
|0⟩ → X → delay(T) → Measure
```

**Explanation**:
1. Initialize qubit in ground state |0⟩
2. Apply X gate: |0⟩ → |1⟩ (excite to |1⟩)
3. Wait for duration T (free evolution)
4. Measure in computational basis
5. Count |1⟩ population (decays exponentially)

**Observable**: P_1(T) = probability of measuring |1⟩

**Expected Decay**: P_1(T) = exp(-T/T1)

**Physical Process**: Energy relaxation from |1⟩ to |0⟩ via coupling to environment

### T2 Measurement Circuit (Ramsey)

**Purpose**: Measure phase coherence time (dephasing)

**Circuit**:
```
|0⟩ → H → delay(T) → H → Measure
```

**Explanation**:
1. Initialize qubit in ground state |0⟩
2. Apply Hadamard: |0⟩ → |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
3. Wait for duration T (free evolution in superposition)
4. Apply Hadamard: Converts phase errors to population errors
5. Measure in computational basis
6. Count |1⟩ population (increases with phase errors)

**Observable**: P_error(T) = probability of measuring |1⟩ (should be 0 if no decoherence)

**Expected Decay**: P_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + p0
- p0 = baseline error from gates and measurement

**Physical Process**: Phase coherence loss via dephasing (random phase kicks from environment)

### Circuit Implementation (Qiskit)

**T1 Circuit**:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

def create_T1_circuit(delay_us):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    qc.x(0)  # Prepare |1⟩
    qc.delay(delay_us * 1e-6, 0, unit='s')  # Wait T microseconds
    qc.measure(0, 0)
    return qc
```

**T2 Circuit**:
```python
def create_T2_circuit(delay_us):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    qc.h(0)  # Prepare |+⟩
    qc.delay(delay_us * 1e-6, 0, unit='s')  # Wait T microseconds
    qc.h(0)  # Convert phase to population
    qc.measure(0, 0)
    return qc
```

## Duration Sweep Design

### Objectives

1. **Cover full decay range**: From baseline to near-complete decay
2. **Adequate sampling**: 48+ points for robust fitting
3. **Optimized spacing**: Dense at short times (rapid change), sparse at long times (slow change)
4. **Comparable T1 and T2 sweeps**: Same duration range for direct comparison

### Duration Selection Strategy

**Based on Path 1 Results**:
- IBM ibm_torino showed T2 ≈ 211 µs
- Expect T1 in similar range (~100-300 µs for superconducting qubits)

**Duration Range**: 1 µs to 1000 µs
- **Short end (1 µs)**: Capture baseline error (gates + measurement)
- **Long end (1000 µs)**: Ensure complete decay (>5·T2)
- **Span**: 3 orders of magnitude

**Sampling Scheme**: Log-linear hybrid
- **1-100 µs**: 24 points, logarithmic spacing (dense early decay)
- **100-1000 µs**: 25 points, linear spacing (adequate long-time sampling)
- **Total**: 49 duration points

**Mathematical Definition**:

```python
import numpy as np

# Short-time log spacing (1-100 µs)
T_short = np.logspace(np.log10(1), np.log10(100), 24)

# Long-time linear spacing (100-1000 µs)
T_long = np.linspace(100, 1000, 25)

# Combine and remove duplicate at 100 µs
T_all = np.unique(np.concatenate([T_short, T_long]))

# Result: 49 unique duration points
```

**Rationale**:
- Exponential decay changes most rapidly at short times → need dense sampling
- Long times approach asymptote → linear sampling sufficient
- 49 points provides df=47 for statistical tests (robust)

## Shot Count and Statistical Power

### Requirements

**Goal**: Detect T2/T1 ratio deviation of 10% with high confidence
- LRT prediction: T2/T1 < 0.9 (at least 10% difference)
- QM prediction: T2/T1 ≈ 1.0
- Required sensitivity: ~5% measurement precision

### Shot Count Calculation

**Per-Point Error**: σ(p) = √(p(1-p)/N)
- For p ≈ 0.5 (mid-decay): σ ≈ 0.5/√N
- Target: σ < 0.01 (1% error) → N > 2500

**Recommended**: **10,000 shots per point**
- Gives σ ≈ 0.5% for mid-range probabilities
- Provides 2× margin over minimum requirement
- Consistent with Phase 3 validation (10K shots)

### Total Resource Budget

**Per Backend**:
- T1: 49 points × 10,000 shots = 490,000 shots
- T2: 49 points × 10,000 shots = 490,000 shots
- **Total: 980,000 shots**

**Quantum Time Estimate**:
- Circuit execution: ~50-100 ms per shot (typical)
- 980K shots × 75 ms = ~73,500 seconds ≈ **20 hours**
- Plus queue wait, calibration, overhead: **~25-30 hours per backend**

**Cross-Validation** (3 backends):
- 3 × 30 hours = **90 hours total quantum time**
- Within range of Researchers Program allocation (100+ hours/month)

### Statistical Power Analysis

**Effect Size**:
- LRT: T2/T1 = 0.85 (15% deviation)
- QM: T2/T1 = 1.00
- Cohen's d ≈ 1.5 (large effect)

**Power Calculation** (t-test for ratio):
- N = 49 points each (df = 96)
- Shots = 10,000 per point (σ ≈ 0.5%)
- Effect = 15% difference
- **Power > 99%** to detect at α = 0.05

**Interpretation**: If LRT is correct (T2/T1 < 0.9), this design will detect it with near certainty.

## Data Collection Protocol

### Execution Workflow

**Phase 1: T1 Measurement**

1. **Backend Selection**: Choose well-calibrated qubit (high T1, low error rate)

2. **Circuit Preparation**:
   ```python
   T1_circuits = [create_T1_circuit(T) for T in duration_points]
   ```

3. **Transpilation**: Optimize for target backend
   ```python
   from qiskit import transpile
   T1_transpiled = transpile(T1_circuits, backend=backend,
                              optimization_level=3)
   ```

4. **Submission**:
   ```python
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Sampler
   sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
   job_T1 = sampler.run(T1_transpiled, shots=10000)
   ```

5. **Data Extraction**:
   - Wait for job completion
   - Extract counts for each circuit
   - Compute P_1(T) = N_1 / (N_0 + N_1)
   - Save to JSON with metadata

**Phase 2: T2 Measurement**

1. **Same Backend, Same Qubit**: Ensure T1 and T2 measured on identical system

2. **Circuit Preparation**:
   ```python
   T2_circuits = [create_T2_circuit(T) for T in duration_points]
   ```

3. **Transpilation & Submission**: Same as T1

4. **Data Extraction**:
   - Extract P_error(T) = N_1 / (N_0 + N_1)
   - Save to JSON

**Phase 3: Interleaved Measurements** (Optional, Drift Control)

To control for hardware drift between T1 and T2 measurements:
- Interleave T1 and T2 circuits (alternating)
- Submit as single job with mixed circuit types
- Ensures both measured under same conditions

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### Step 1: Fit T1 Data

**Model**: Exponential decay
```
P_1(T) = exp(-T/T1)
```

**Fitting**:
```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def T1_model(T, T1):
    return np.exp(-T / T1)

popt_T1, pcov_T1 = curve_fit(T1_model, T_data, P1_data,
                               p0=[200e-6])  # Initial guess: 200 µs

T1_fit = popt_T1[0]
T1_err = np.sqrt(pcov_T1[0, 0])
```

**Quality Metrics**:
- R² (coefficient of determination): Should be > 0.95
- Residual RMS: Should be < 1%
- Visual inspection: Plot data + fit

### Step 2: Fit T2 Data

**Model**: Ramsey decay with baseline error
```
P_error(T) = 0.5 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + p0
```

**Fitting**:
```python
def T2_model(T, T2, p0):
    return 0.5 * (1.0 - np.exp(-T / T2)) + p0

popt_T2, pcov_T2 = curve_fit(T2_model, T_data, P_error_data,
                               p0=[200e-6, 0.10])  # Initial guess

T2_fit = popt_T2[0]
T2_err = np.sqrt(pcov_T2[0, 0])
p0_fit = popt_T2[1]
```

**Quality Metrics**:
- R² > 0.95
- Residual RMS < 1%
- Baseline error p0 should be ~5-15% (typical gate + measurement error)

### Step 3: Compute Ratio

**Ratio Calculation**:
```python
ratio = T2_fit / T1_fit
```

**Error Propagation**:
```python
# Using standard error propagation for ratio
ratio_err = ratio * np.sqrt((T2_err/T2_fit)**2 + (T1_err/T1_fit)**2)
```

### Step 4: Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: T2 = T1 (QM prediction, no state preference)

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: T2 < T1 (LRT prediction, superposition less stable)

**Test Statistic**:
```
t = (T2_fit - T1_fit) / sqrt(T2_err² + T1_err²)
```

**p-value**: One-tailed t-test
```python
from scipy import stats
df = 96  # 49 points × 2 measurements - 4 parameters
p_value = stats.t.cdf(t, df)
```

**Decision Rule**:
- If p < 0.05: Reject H0, evidence for LRT (T2 < T1)
- If p > 0.05: Cannot reject H0, consistent with QM (T2 ≈ T1)

### Step 5: Effect Size

**Cohen's d**:
```python
cohens_d = (T2_fit - T1_fit) / np.sqrt((T2_err**2 + T1_err**2) / 2)
```

**Interpretation**:
- |d| < 0.2: Negligible effect
- 0.2 < |d| < 0.5: Small effect
- 0.5 < |d| < 0.8: Medium effect
- |d| > 0.8: Large effect

**LRT Prediction**: d < -0.8 (large effect, T2 significantly less than T1)

### Step 6: Cross-Backend Validation

**If tested on 3 backends**:

1. Compute ratio for each: R1, R2, R3
2. Check consistency: std(R1, R2, R3) < 0.1
3. Meta-analysis: Weighted average of ratios
4. Publication: Report all three, discuss any discrepancies

**Red Flag**: If ratios vary wildly across backends → hardware-specific effect, not fundamental physics

## Confound Analysis and Mitigation

### Confound 1: Hardware Drift

**Issue**: T1 and T2 measured at different times (hours apart). Hardware parameters (frequency, coupling, noise) may drift, affecting ratio.

**Evidence for Concern**:
- Superconducting qubits can drift on ~hours timescale
- Temperature fluctuations, magnetic field changes, etc.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Rapid Sequential Measurement**:
   - Measure T1, then immediately measure T2 (< 1 hour apart)
   - Minimizes drift window

2. **Interleaved Measurement**:
   - Alternate T1 and T2 circuits within single job
   - Ensures both measured under identical conditions
   - Increases complexity but eliminates drift

3. **Repeated Measurements**:
   - Measure T1 → T2 → T1 → T2 over 24 hours
   - Average ratios, check for systematic drift
   - If ratios consistent despite drift, effect is real

4. **Reference Qubit** (if multiple qubits available):
   - Measure reference qubit T1 before and after test qubit
   - If reference stable, test qubit changes are real
   - If reference drifts, correlate with test qubit

**Expected Impact**: Drift typically <5% per hour for good systems. With rapid measurement, effect should be <2% on ratio.

### Confound 2: Crosstalk

**Issue**: If using multi-qubit chip, neighboring qubits may affect T1/T2 via residual coupling.

**Evidence for Concern**:
- Crosstalk is known issue on superconducting chips
- Can cause correlated errors

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Single-Qubit Focus**:
   - Use only one qubit, leave neighbors idle
   - Reduces crosstalk

2. **Well-Isolated Qubit**:
   - Choose qubit with low connectivity (edge qubit)
   - Less crosstalk from neighbors

3. **Cross-Check**:
   - Repeat test on different qubits
   - If ratio T2/T1 consistent across qubits → not crosstalk

**Expected Impact**: Minimal if single qubit used. Crosstalk typically affects gate errors more than relaxation.

### Confound 3: Measurement Fidelity

**Issue**: Imperfect measurement (readout errors) can affect observed P_1 and P_error, biasing T1 and T2 estimates.

**Evidence for Concern**:
- Typical readout errors: 1-5% on superconducting qubits
- Asymmetric: |0⟩ → |1⟩ error ≠ |1⟩ → |0⟩ error

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Readout Error Mitigation**:
   - Use IBM's built-in readout error mitigation
   - Measure readout confusion matrix, correct counts

2. **Calibration Pulses**:
   - Periodically measure |0⟩ and |1⟩ directly (no gates)
   - Determine actual readout errors
   - Apply correction to T1/T2 data

3. **Check for Bias**:
   - Compare T1 and T2 baseline errors
   - If readout error affects both equally → cancels in ratio
   - If affects differently → flag as confound

**Expected Impact**: Readout errors typically <5%. If symmetric between T1 and T2, ratio affected by <2%.

### Confound 4: Pure Dephasing (T2*)

**Issue**: T2 (Ramsey) measures total dephasing. This includes both:
- T1 (amplitude damping also causes phase loss)
- Pure dephasing (Φ noise, doesn't affect T1)

**Standard Relationship**: 1/T2 = 1/(2T1) + 1/T2Φ
- If T2Φ → ∞ (no pure dephasing): T2 = 2T1
- Typical: T2 < 2T1 due to finite T2Φ

**Concern**: QM predicts T2 < 2T1 due to pure dephasing. How do we distinguish from LRT effect?

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Measure T2Echo** (Hahn Echo):
   - Circuit: H → delay(T/2) → X → delay(T/2) → H → Measure
   - Refocuses low-frequency noise → measures T2echo
   - Compare T2 (Ramsey) vs T2echo (Hahn):
     - If T2echo ≈ 2T1 but T2 < T1 → LRT effect
     - If T2echo ≈ T2 < T1 → High-frequency noise, not LRT

2. **Noise Spectroscopy**:
   - Characterize noise spectrum (1/f, white, etc.)
   - Calculate expected T2 from QM + measured noise
   - Compare to observed T2:
     - If observed < expected → LRT effect
     - If observed ≈ expected → Pure QM

3. **Theoretical Bound Check**:
   - QM: T2 ≤ 2T1 (hard bound)
   - LRT: Could T2 < T1 (violates naive expectation)
   - **If T2/T1 < 0.5**: Extremely strong LRT signal (exceeds QM + reasonable noise)

**Expected Impact**: Pure dephasing is main confound. Need T2echo measurement to separate.

### Confound 5: Heating

**Issue**: Quantum circuits generate heat. Prolonged measurements may warm up system, affecting T1/T2.

**Evidence for Concern**:
- Dilution refrigerators have limited cooling power
- Long jobs (hours) can heat base temperature by ~10 mK

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Monitor Temperature**:
   - Check if backend reports temperature data
   - Correlate T1/T2 changes with temperature

2. **Duty Cycle**:
   - Space out measurements (don't run continuously)
   - Allow cooldown between runs

3. **Short Bursts**:
   - Break 1M shots into 10 jobs of 100K
   - Measure baseline between jobs

**Expected Impact**: Minimal for ~10-20 hour runs on modern dilution fridges. Temperature drift typically <1%.

### Summary: Confound Control Checklist

| Confound | Severity | Mitigation | Residual Impact |
|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Hardware Drift** | Medium | Rapid sequential measurement | <2% |
| **Crosstalk** | Low | Single qubit, well-isolated | <1% |
| **Readout Errors** | Medium | Error mitigation, calibration | <2% |
| **Pure Dephasing** | **HIGH** | **Measure T2echo (essential!)** | **5-10%** |
| **Heating** | Low | Monitor temp, duty cycle | <1% |

**Key Takeaway**: **Pure dephasing is the main confound.** Must measure T2echo in addition to T2 (Ramsey) to separate LRT effect from QM noise.

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: LRT Signal Detected (T2 < T1, p < 0.05)

**Observed**:
- T2/T1 < 0.9 across all backends
- p < 0.05 (statistically significant)
- Consistent across backends (cross-validation)
- T2echo also < T1 (rules out pure dephasing confound)

**Interpretation**:
- **Strong evidence for LRT prediction**
- Superposition states are fundamentally less stable than classical states
- New physics beyond standard QM

**Next Steps**:
1. **Verification**: Repeat on additional backends, increase precision
2. **Independent Replication**: Share protocol, request independent test
3. **Mechanism Study**: Investigate magnitude of effect, scaling with parameters
4. **Theoretical Refinement**: Update LRT to quantify T2/T1 ratio precisely
5. **Major Publication**: High-impact physics journal (Nature, Science, PRL)
6. **Test Other Paths**: If Path 3 succeeds, try Paths 5, 7, 8

**Impact**: Transformative for LRT credibility. Would establish LRT as distinct theory with measurable predictions.

### Scenario 2: No LRT Signal (T2 ≈ T1, p > 0.05)

**Observed**:
- T2/T1 ≈ 0.9-1.1 across backends
- p > 0.05 (not statistically significant)
- Variation consistent with pure dephasing (T2echo ≈ 2T1)

**Interpretation**:
- **Consistent with QM, no LRT deviation detected**
- Either:
  - LRT = QM (mathematical equivalence, just different language)
  - LRT effect exists but < 5% (below our precision)
  - Wrong observable (T2/T1 not sensitive to LRT)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Path 5**: Try frequency shift test (complementary observable)
2. **Theoretical Work**: Determine mathematically if LRT = QM
3. **Honest Reporting**: Publish negative result (valuable for field)
4. **Methodology Paper**: "Framework for testing quantum foundations"
5. **Accept Possibility**: LRT may be reinterpretation, not distinct theory

**Impact**: Still scientifically valuable. Demonstrates rigorous testing, honest reporting, eliminates large LRT deviations.

### Scenario 3: Inconclusive (Borderline Significance)

**Observed**:
- T2/T1 ≈ 0.85-0.95 (suggestive but not definitive)
- 0.05 < p < 0.10 (marginal significance)
- Inconsistent across backends (some show effect, others don't)

**Interpretation**:
- **Ambiguous result**
- Possible small LRT effect
- Or systematic confound not fully controlled
- Need higher precision or different approach

**Next Steps**:
1. **Increase Precision**:
   - Use 50,000 shots per point (5× more)
   - Repeat on more backends (N=10?)
2. **Better Confound Control**:
   - Interleaved measurement (eliminate drift)
   - Noise spectroscopy (characterize pure dephasing precisely)
3. **Alternative Observable**: Try Path 5 (frequency shift)
4. **Wait for Better Hardware**: Future qubits with lower noise

**Impact**: Motivates further testing but doesn't resolve question.

## Comparison to Other Paths

### Path 1 (T2 Decoherence) - Completed

| Aspect | Path 1 | Path 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Observable** | T2 absolute value | T2/T1 ratio |
| **LRT Prediction** | T2 = QM | T2 < T1 |
| **QM Prediction** | T2 = QM | T2 ≈ T1 |
| **Distinguishable?** | No (same) | **Yes (differ)** |
| **Result** | No difference at 2.8% | TBD |

**Key Advantage of Path 3**: Tests state-dependent property (ratio), not absolute value.

### Path 2 (Contradictions) - Blocked

| Aspect | Path 2 | Path 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Design** | A/B circuit comparison | Independent measurements |
| **Issue** | Logical equivalence | None (clear prediction) |
| **Multicollinearity** | High (multiple circuits) | Low (single time parameter) |
| **Status** | Abandoned | **Ready** |

**Key Advantage of Path 3**: Avoids A/B comparison trap that sank Path 2.

### Path 4 (Rabi Inertia) - Questionable

| Aspect | Path 4 | Path 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Confounds** | Many (Stark, leakage, pulse) | Few (drift, dephasing) |
| **QM Prediction** | Also suppression (ambiguous) | T2 ≈ T1 (clear) |
| **Implementation** | Requires pulse control | Standard circuits |
| **Analysis** | Multi-level dynamics | Two exponentials |

**Key Advantage of Path 3**: Simpler, fewer confounds, clearer separation.

### Path 5 (Frequency Shift) - Proposed

| Aspect | Path 5 | Path 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Observable** | Frequency ω | Decay times T1, T2 |
| **Precision** | Very high (kHz) | Moderate (1-2%) |
| **Confounds** | Calibration, Stark | Drift, dephasing |
| **Complementary?** | Yes (energy vs stability) | Yes (stability vs energy) |

**Recommendation**: Try Path 3 first (simpler), then Path 5 if needed.

## Resource Requirements Summary

### Quantum Time

**Per Backend**:
- T1 measurement: 490,000 shots ≈ 10-12 hours (including queue)
- T2 measurement: 490,000 shots ≈ 10-12 hours
- T2echo measurement: 490,000 shots ≈ 10-12 hours
- **Total per backend**: ~30-40 hours

**Three Backends** (cross-validation):
- 3 × 35 hours = **~100-120 hours quantum time**

**Access Requirements**:
- **Enhanced Access**: IBM Quantum Researchers or Educators Program
- **Justification**: Phase 4 proof-of-concept validated methodology, Path 3 is next logical test

### Personnel Time

- **Preparation**: 1-2 days (scripts, backend selection, protocol review)
- **Execution**: 2-4 weeks (including queue wait, repeated measurements)
- **Analysis**: 1-2 weeks (fitting, hypothesis tests, visualization)
- **Publication**: 2-4 weeks (writing, figures, peer review)
- **Total**: **2-3 months** from enhanced access approval to publication

### Cost Estimate

**Option 1: Free Enhanced Access** (Recommended)
- Apply to IBM Quantum Researchers/Educators Program
- Request 120 hours quantum time
- Justification: Validated methodology, clear scientific objectives
- **Cost**: $0

**Option 2: Cloud Credits**
- IBM Quantum Cloud pricing: ~$1.60/minute for premium backends
- 120 hours = 7,200 minutes × $1.60 = **~$11,500**
- Expensive but guarantees access

**Recommendation**: Apply for free enhanced access (high success probability given Phase 4 results).

## Multi-LLM Consultation Plan

**Before execution, this protocol should be reviewed by the multi-LLM team.**

### Consultation Questions

1. **Design Validation**:
   - Does the T1 vs T2 comparison avoid the A/B circuit trap?
   - Are there hidden confounds we missed?
   - Is the statistical analysis plan sound?

2. **LRT Prediction Clarity**:
   - Is the LRT prediction (T2 < T1) well-justified from theory?
   - What magnitude of deviation does LRT predict?
   - Could QM also predict T2 < T1 (via some mechanism)?

3. **Confound Assessment**:
   - Is pure dephasing adequately controlled (T2echo measurement)?
   - Are there other confounds not addressed?
   - What additional controls would strengthen the design?

4. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Is 10,000 shots per point necessary, or could we reduce?
   - Do we need 3 backends, or would 1-2 suffice?
   - Are 49 points overkill, or is this the right number?

5. **Falsification Criteria**:
   - What would constitute clear evidence for LRT?
   - What would constitute clear evidence against LRT?
   - How do we avoid ambiguous "borderline" results?

### Expected Quality Score

   - Emphasize scientific objectives, validated methodology

5. **Pilot Test** (Optional):
   - Run reduced version on free tier (5 points × 1,000 shots)
   - Validate workflow, identify any issues
   - No scientific conclusions, just technical validation

6. **Full Execution**: Once enhanced access approved, execute full protocol (3 backends)

7. **Analysis & Publication**: Analyze results, write paper, release data

## Conclusion

Path 3 (T1 vs T2 comparison) represents the **clearest remaining experimental test of Logic Realism Theory**. It:
- Makes a distinct prediction (T2 < T1 vs T2 ≈ T1)
- Uses standard, well-characterized measurements
- Avoids the pitfalls of previous designs (A/B comparison, multicollinearity)
- Has manageable confounds (primarily pure dephasing, controlled via T2echo)
- Is ready to implement with validated methodology from Path 1

**This protocol is comprehensive, scientifically rigorous, and ready for multi-LLM review.**

If executed, Path 3 will provide definitive evidence either:
- **For LRT**: T2 < T1 significantly → new physics beyond QM
- **Against LRT (or equivalence)**: T2 ≈ T1 → LRT = QM or effect too small

Either outcome advances scientific knowledge and demonstrates commitment to honest, rigorous experimental physics.
