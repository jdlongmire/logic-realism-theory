# Test Design: "Logical State-Dependent Error" Prediction

**Session**: 2.6 (Revision based on Grok's insight)
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Phase 1 - Protocol Design (NO CODE YET)
**Supersedes**: "No Actualized Contradictions" test (fatal flaw identified)

---

## Lesson from Previous Attempts

**Session 2.5 (QEC entropy-error test):**
- Compared Circuit A (low entropy) vs Circuit B (high entropy)
- Result: Perfect multicollinearity (VIF = ∞), duration confounds

**Session 2.6 (Contradiction test):**
- Compared "contradiction circuits" vs "control circuits"
- Result: Fatal flaw - doesn't differentiate LRT from QM, definition ambiguous

**Root Cause (Gemini's insight):**
> "Any test comparing two different circuits is likely doomed."

**Why:** Circuit A vs Circuit B introduces confounds (duration, gates, noise) that cause multicollinearity.

**New Approach:**
- **Single circuit** with continuous parameter variation
- Look for **quantitative deviation** from QM baseline
- **Residual analysis**: Isolate LRT effect after accounting for known physics

---

## Part 1: The Testable Hypothesis

### LRT's Core Claim (from paper)

**Identity + Non-Contradiction + Excluded Middle = Classical Reality**

In quantum mechanics:
- **Classical state** (e.g., |0⟩): All three laws apply (Id + NC + EM)
- **Superposition** (e.g., |+⟩): EM is "relaxed" (Id + NC only)

**LRT Implication:**
If superposition is a state of "relaxed logical constraint" (EM not enforced), it should be **logically less stable** than a classical state.

**Prediction:**
A qubit in superposition should exhibit **excess error** beyond what standard decoherence (T1/T2) predicts.

### Operational Hypothesis

**Experiment A (Classical State - Control):**
- Initialize |0⟩ (classical, EM applies)
- Apply identity-equivalent gates for time T
- Measure in Z-basis
- Expected error: p_log(A) ≈ p_T1 (amplitude damping only)

**Experiment B (Superposition State - Test):**
- Initialize |+⟩ (superposition, EM relaxed)
- Apply **identical** gates for time T
- Measure in X-basis
- Expected error: p_log(B) = p_T2 + p_LRT

**LRT Prediction:**
```
p_LRT > 0
```

**Standard QM Prediction:**
```
p_LRT = 0 (no excess error beyond T2)
```

**Statistical Test:**
```
H0: p_LRT = 0 (standard QM)
H1: p_LRT > 0 (LRT)
```

---

## Part 2: Experimental Design

### Experiment A: Classical State Error Rate

**Purpose:** Establish T1 baseline (amplitude damping)

**Protocol:**
1. Initialize qubit to |0⟩
2. Apply identity-equivalent pulse sequence for duration T
   - Options: Repeated X-X pairs, H-Z-Z-H, or just idle
   - Total duration: T (variable parameter)
3. Measure in Z-basis (computational basis)
4. Repeat N times (e.g., N=10,000)
5. Calculate error rate: p_log(A) = P(measured |1⟩ | prepared |0⟩)

**What this measures:**
- Pure T1 decay (amplitude damping)
- |0⟩ → |1⟩ transitions due to thermal excitation
- No dephasing contribution (measurement in same basis as state)

**Expected result:**
```
p_log(A) ≈ (1 - exp(-T/T1))/2
```

### Experiment B: Superposition State Error Rate

**Purpose:** Measure total error in superposition, compare to T2 baseline

**Protocol:**
1. Initialize qubit to |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
   - Apply H gate to |0⟩
2. Apply **IDENTICAL** identity-equivalent pulse sequence for duration T
   - Same gates as Experiment A
   - Same total duration T
3. Measure in X-basis (superposition basis)
   - Apply H gate before measurement, then measure in Z
4. Repeat N times (e.g., N=10,000)
5. Calculate error rate: p_log(B) = P(measured |-⟩ | prepared |+⟩)

**What this measures:**
- T2 decay (dephasing + amplitude damping)
- Loss of X-basis coherence
- Standard Ramsey-type measurement

**Expected result (Standard QM):**
```
p_log(B) ≈ (1 - exp(-T/T2))/2
```

**Expected result (LRT):**
```
p_log(B) ≈ (1 - exp(-T/T2))/2 + p_LRT(T)

where p_LRT(T) is the EXCESS error due to logical instability
```

### Key Design Feature: Avoiding Multicollinearity

**Critical:** Both experiments use THE SAME CIRCUIT
- Same pulse sequence
- Same duration T
- Same noise environment
- Only differences: Initial state (|0⟩ vs |+⟩) and measurement basis (Z vs X)

**No multicollinearity** because we're not comparing two circuits. We're comparing:
- Measured p_log(B) vs
- Predicted p_T2 (from independent characterization)

**Residual analysis:**
```
p_LRT = p_log(B)_observed - p_log(B)_predicted_from_T2
```

## Part 3: Statistical Model

### Baseline Characterization

**Step 1: Measure T1 and T2 independently**

Use standard protocols:
1. **T1 measurement:** Prepare |1⟩, wait time τ, measure in Z, fit decay
2. **T2 measurement:** Prepare |+⟩, wait time τ, measure in X, fit decay
3. Repeat across range of τ values to get T1, T2 with confidence intervals

**Result:** T1 ± δT1, T2 ± δT2

### Predicted Error Rates (Baseline QM)

From T1, T2 characterization:
```
p_log(A)_pred = (1 - exp(-T/T1))/2
p_log(B)_pred = (1 - exp(-T/T2))/2
```

### Residual Analysis (LRT Test)

For each duration T:
1. Measure p_log(B)_obs from Experiment B
2. Calculate predicted p_log(B)_pred from T2
3. Compute residual:
   ```
   Δp(T) = p_log(B)_obs - p_log(B)_pred
   ```

**LRT Hypothesis:**
```
Δp(T) = p_LRT(T) + ε

where:
- p_LRT(T): Excess error (LRT prediction: > 0)
- ε: Measurement noise (normal distribution)
```

**Statistical test:**
- One-sample t-test: Is Δp significantly > 0?
- Regression: Δp(T) = α + β*T + ε (test β > 0)
- Confidence interval: Does CI for Δp exclude 0?

### Regression Model

**Full model accounting for all sources:**
```
p_log(B) = α + β_T2 * (1 - exp(-T/T2)) + β_LRT * f_LRT(T) + ε

where:
- β_T2: T2 decay coefficient (expect ≈ 0.5 from theory)
- β_LRT: LRT excess error coefficient (LRT: > 0, QM: = 0)
- f_LRT(T): Functional form of LRT effect (could be linear, exponential, etc.)
```

**Simplified (residual) model:**
```
Δp(T) = β_LRT * T + ε

H0: β_LRT = 0
H1: β_LRT > 0
```

### VIF Analysis (Why This Avoids Multicollinearity)

**In Session 2.5:** We compared Circuit A vs Circuit B
- I_circuit and duration were perfectly correlated (VIF = ∞)
- Can't isolate circuit effect from duration

**In this test:** We compare measurement vs prediction
- No circuit indicator variable
- T is the only predictor
- Residual Δp vs T regression has VIF = 1 (by definition, single predictor)

**Proof:**
```
VIF = 1 / (1 - R²)

For single predictor: VIF = 1 (no multicollinearity possible)
```

## Part 4: Confound Identification

### Confound 1: T1/T2 Measurement Uncertainty

**The Problem:**
- T1, T2 have measurement uncertainty (±δT1, ±δT2)
- Propagates to p_pred uncertainty
- Could create apparent Δp when none exists

**Mitigation:**
- Use large sample sizes for T1/T2 characterization (reduce δT1, δT2)
- Propagate uncertainties through to p_pred
- Include uncertainty in statistical test (weighted regression)

**Statistical control:**
```
Δp(T) ± σ_Δp where σ_Δp = sqrt(σ_obs² + σ_pred²)
```

### Confound 2: Pulse Imperfections

**The Problem:**
- Identity-equivalent sequences may not be perfect identity
- Systematic errors accumulate differently in |0⟩ vs |+⟩
- Could mimic p_LRT

**Mitigation:**
- Use randomized benchmarking to characterize gate errors
- Include gate fidelity in baseline model
- Test multiple identity-equivalent sequences (X-X, H-Z-Z-H, idle)
- If p_LRT consistent across sequences → not pulse artifact

**Control:**
- Measure average gate fidelity F_avg
- Include in model: p_pred = f(T1, T2, F_avg)

### Confound 3: Measurement Basis Calibration

**The Problem:**
- X-basis measurement requires H gate before readout
- H gate imperfections → apparent errors
- Affects Experiment B only

**Mitigation:**
- Calibrate H gate separately (process tomography)
- Measure H gate fidelity F_H
- Correct p_log(B) for H gate errors:
  ```
  p_log(B)_corrected = (p_log(B)_obs - p_H_error) / (1 - p_H_error)
  ```

**Verification:**
- Test with Y-basis (requires S†HS gates) - should see same Δp
- If Δp only in X-basis → calibration artifact

### Confound 4: State Preparation Errors

**The Problem:**
- |0⟩ preparation may have error (thermal population)
- |+⟩ preparation requires H gate (additional error)
- Asymmetric errors between experiments

**Mitigation:**
- Measure state prep fidelity via tomography
- Include in baseline model
- Use active cooling to maximize |0⟩ fidelity

**Control:**
```
p_prep(|0⟩) = thermal population (from T1)
p_prep(|+⟩) = p_prep(|0⟩) + p_H_error
```

### Confound 5: Environmental Noise Fluctuations

**The Problem:**
- T1, T2 may drift between characterization and experiments
- Creates apparent Δp from temporal variation

**Mitigation:**
- Interleave characterization and experiments (measure T1, T2 daily)
- Randomize experiment order (A, B, A, B, ...)
- Include time as covariate to detect drift

**Control:**
- Monitor T1, T2 vs time
- Reject data if drift > threshold (e.g., 10%)

### Confound Summary

| Confound | Source | Mitigation | Statistical Control |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| T1/T2 uncertainty | Measurement noise | Large samples | Uncertainty propagation |
| Pulse errors | Gate imperfections | Randomized benchmarking | F_avg in model |
| Basis calibration | H gate errors | Process tomography | Basis-dependent test |
| State prep | Thermal + H errors | Active cooling | Include p_prep |
| Noise drift | Temporal variation | Interleaved measurement | Time covariate |

**ALL confounds are MEASURABLE and can be included in baseline model.**

## Part 5: Predicted Outcomes

### Scenario 1: LRT is Correct (p_LRT > 0)

**Observable signature:**
- Δp(T) > 0 for all T
- Δp increases with T (more time for logical instability to manifest)
- Effect size: p_LRT ~ 0.01-0.10 (1-10% excess error)
- Consistent across different identity-equivalent sequences
- Consistent across X, Y measurement bases

**Statistical result:**
- t-test: p < 0.05
- Regression: β_LRT > 0, p < 0.05
- 95% CI for Δp excludes 0

**Physical interpretation:**
- Superposition states (EM relaxed) are logically less stable
- Excess error is LRT's "logical decoherence" beyond physical decoherence

### Scenario 2: Standard QM (p_LRT = 0)

**Observable signature:**
- Δp(T) ≈ 0 within measurement uncertainty
- No systematic deviation from T2 prediction
- Δp fluctuates randomly (noise)

**Statistical result:**
- t-test: p > 0.05
- Regression: β_LRT ≈ 0, not significant
- 95% CI for Δp includes 0

**Physical interpretation:**
- No evidence for logical instability beyond known physics
- T2 fully explains superposition decay

### Scenario 3: Design Flawed (Confounds Detected)

**Observable signature:**
- Δp depends on pulse sequence (pulse error artifact)
- Δp only in X-basis, not Y-basis (calibration artifact)
- Δp correlates with time of day (drift artifact)

**Statistical result:**
- Large residuals after accounting for confounds
- VIF > 5 when including controls (unexpected multicollinearity)

**Physical interpretation:**
- Apparent p_LRT is actually measurement artifact
- Need to redesign or improve calibration

## Part 6: Why This Design is Superior

### Comparison to Previous Attempts

| Feature | Session 2.5 QEC | Session 2.6 Contradiction | This Test |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Circuit comparison? | Yes (A vs B) | Yes (contradiction vs control) | **No (measurement vs prediction)** |
| Multicollinearity | VIF = ∞ | VIF > 10 expected | **VIF = 1** |
| LRT vs QM differentiation | β > 0 vs β = 0 | Unclear (both forbid contradictions) | **p_LRT > 0 vs = 0** |
| Baseline characterization | Complex (entropy) | Undefined | **Standard (T1/T2)** |
| Confounds | 8+ identified | 8+ identified | **5, all measurable** |
| Implementation complexity | High (QEC) | Medium (paradox circuits) | **Low (standard protocols)** |

### Key Advantages

1. **No A/B circuit comparison** → No structural confounds
2. **Residual analysis** → Isolate LRT effect from known physics
3. **Well-characterized baseline** → T1/T2 are standard measurements
4. **Single predictor** → No multicollinearity (VIF = 1)
5. **Quantitative deviation** → Not just yes/no, but "how much?"
6. **Simple implementation** → Basic T1/Ramsey experiments

### Potential Weaknesses

1. **Small effect size:** If p_LRT ~ 0.01, need large N for statistical power
2. **Baseline accuracy:** Requires very precise T1/T2 measurement
3. **Confound control:** Must carefully calibrate gates and measure errors
4. **Theoretical ambiguity:** What functional form should p_LRT have? (Linear, exponential, etc.)

**Mitigation:** Power analysis to determine required N, rigorous calibration protocols, test multiple functional forms

---

## Part 7: Open Questions

### Question 1: What is the expected effect size?

**Current assumption:** p_LRT ~ 0.01-0.10 (1-10% excess error)

**Basis:**
- Must be detectable but not obvious (or it would have been seen)
- Comparable to gate errors in NISQ devices (0.1-1%)
- Large enough to measure with reasonable N

**Need to determine:**
- Does LRT predict a specific functional form? (p_LRT ∝ T, ∝ T², etc.)
- Is there a theoretical estimate from paper?

### Question 2: What functional form for p_LRT?

**Options:**
- Linear: p_LRT = k * T (constant rate)
- Exponential: p_LRT = k * (1 - exp(-T/τ_LRT)) (saturation)
- Power law: p_LRT = k * T^n (accelerating/decelerating)

**Approach:**
- Test all three, see which fits best
- Theoretical guidance from LRT framework?

### Question 3: Does p_LRT depend on qubit type?

**Consideration:**
- Different qubits have different T1, T2 (superconducting, trapped ion, etc.)
- Is p_LRT absolute or relative to T2?

**Test:**
- Run on multiple qubit modalities
- If p_LRT/T2 constant → relative effect
- If p_LRT absolute → different physics

### Question 4: How do we verify it's not just unknown physics?

**Challenge:**
- Even if Δp > 0, could be some other effect (not LRT)
- How to distinguish LRT's "logical instability" from other mechanisms?

**Possible signatures:**
- Specific T dependence predicted by LRT
- Correlation with other LRT predictions (e.g., from Idea 2 Rabi test)
- Absence in classical states (Exp A should show Δp = 0)

---

## Part 9: Power Analysis (Preliminary)

### Statistical Power Calculation

**Setup:**
- Effect size: d = p_LRT / σ_Δp
- Assume p_LRT = 0.02 (2% excess error)
- Assume σ_Δp = sqrt(p*(1-p)/N) ≈ sqrt(0.5*0.5/N)
- Significance: α = 0.05
- Power: 1 - β = 0.80 (80% chance to detect if real)

**Required sample size:**
```
For one-sample t-test:
N = (z_α + z_β)² * σ² / (p_LRT)²

For d = 0.2 (small effect):
N ≈ 400 per condition

For d = 0.5 (medium effect):
N ≈ 64 per condition

For d = 0.8 (large effect):
N ≈ 26 per condition
```

**Planned N:** 10,000 per condition (conservative, allows detection of d ≥ 0.1)

### Minimum Detectable Effect

With N = 10,000:
```
σ_Δp = sqrt(0.25/10000) = 0.005 (0.5% standard error)

95% CI half-width ≈ 1.96 * 0.005 = 0.01 (1%)

Minimum detectable p_LRT ≈ 0.01 (1% excess error)
```

**Conclusion:** With N=10,000, we can detect excess error as small as 1%.

**Design:** Compare measured p_log(B) vs predicted p_T2, look for residual p_LRT > 0

**Key Innovation:** Avoids A/B circuit comparison (single circuit, residual analysis)

**Multicollinearity:** VIF = 1 (single predictor, no confounds)

**Implementation:** Simple (standard T1/Ramsey experiments)

**Expected Outcome:** p_LRT ~ 0.01-0.10 if LRT correct, ≈ 0 if QM correct
