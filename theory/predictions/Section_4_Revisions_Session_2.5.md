# Section 4 Revisions: QEC Prediction Testability

**Based on**: Session 2.5 exhaustive investigation (Oct 26, 2025)
**Authors**: Claude Code + Multi-LLM consultation (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini)
**Status**: MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

After exhaustive investigation involving:
- 4 independent simulation approaches (~2,320 lines of code)
- 9 distinct test protocols
- External expert consultation and verification
- Empirical validation of all claims

**Conclusion**: The QEC prediction as currently stated (lines 311-316) has **fundamental testability challenges** that require honest acknowledgment and protocol refinement before claiming near-term experimental validation.

**Recommendation**: Revise Section 4 to acknowledge challenges, clarify entropy definitions, and reframe timeline from "testable on current NISQ" to "testable with refined protocols and future capabilities."

## Key Findings from Investigation

### Finding 1: Measurement-Reset Entropy Misconception

**Current text** (lines 352-353):
> "CPTP measurement/reset blocks (ℰ_meas): ΔS > 0 (entropy-increasing due to information gain/loss)"

**Empirical reality**:
- Measurement projects to eigenstate: ρ → |0⟩⟨0| or |1⟩⟨1| (reduces entropy)
- Reset enforces: ρ → |0⟩⟨0| (entropy = 0)
- **Four independent tests confirm**: Measurement-reset sequences have ΔS ≈ 0.000 nats

**Issue**: This confuses:
- **System entropy** S(ρ_sys): Decreases with measurement (projection)
- **Total entropy** S_total = S_sys + S_env: Increases (2nd law)
- **Logical entropy** S(ρ_logical): Can increase with errors in code space

**Correction needed**: Specify which entropy type the prediction concerns.

---

### Finding 2: Multicollinearity is Fundamental

**Current text** (line 391):
> "ΔS often correlates with gate duration... Use fixed-duration protocols or explicitly control for duration"

**Empirical reality**:
- Test 2 (noise variation): VIF(ΔS, p_phys) = 11.2 (severe)
- Test 3 (circuit structure): VIF = ∞ (perfect multicollinearity)
- Test 4 (differential decoherence): Correlation(duration, ΔS) = -0.9957

**Root cause**: In quantum systems:
- Longer duration → more decoherence → higher ΔS (fundamental coupling)
- Measurements take longer than unitaries → duration confound
- Higher noise → both higher p_phys AND higher ΔS (spurious correlation)

**Issue**: "Explicitly control for duration" is insufficient when correlation > 0.95

**Correction needed**: Acknowledge multicollinearity challenge, require VIF diagnostics.

---

### Finding 3: Protocol Impracticalities

**Current text** (line 366):
> "Equalize T₁/T₂ exposure by matching total duration T between low-entropy and high-entropy sequences"

**Simulation findings**:
- Delay gates break density matrix simulation (cannot measure ΔS)
- Identity gates cause decoherence (don't achieve "fixed T₁/T₂")
- Statistical control fails with perfect multicollinearity
- Duration matching without breaking entropy measurement: **no working solution found**

**Issue**: Practical implementation challenges not acknowledged

**Correction needed**: Specify technical requirements (tomography, hardware-specific protocols).

## Proposed Revisions

### Revision 1: Update Lines 311-316 (Main Claim)

**BEFORE:**
```
**If von Neumann entropy change (ΔS) is manipulated at fixed decoherence times (T₁, T₂)
and gate durations, LRT predicts β > 0 in the error scaling model below.**

**Decoherence-only frameworks predict β = 0.**

**This provides a falsifiable discriminator testable on current NISQ-era quantum hardware.**
```

**AFTER:**
```
**If von Neumann entropy change (ΔS) can be varied independently of decoherence time
and gate duration, LRT predicts β > 0 in the error scaling model below.**

**Decoherence-only frameworks predict β = 0.**

**This provides a falsifiable discriminator, though experimental validation requires
addressing fundamental challenges in isolating entropy effects from duration-dependent
decoherence (see Experimental Challenges below).**
```

**Rationale**: Honest about testability challenges while maintaining core prediction.

---

### Revision 2: Fix Lines 352-354 (Entropy Specification)

**BEFORE:**
```
For quantum operations:
- **Unitary blocks** (U): ΔS ≈ 0 (entropy-preserving)
- **CPTP measurement/reset blocks** (ℰ_meas): ΔS > 0 (entropy-increasing due to
  information gain/loss)
```

**AFTER:**
```
For quantum operations, entropy changes depend on which entropy is measured:

**System Entropy** (S_sys = -Tr(ρ_sys ln ρ_sys)):
- **Unitary blocks** (U): ΔS_sys ≈ 0 (entropy-preserving)
- **Ideal measurement/reset**: ΔS_sys < 0 (projection reduces entropy)
- **Noisy measurement/reset**: ΔS_sys may increase due to imperfections

**Total Entropy** (S_total = S_sys + S_env):
- All CPTP maps: ΔS_total ≥ 0 (second law)
- Measurements transfer entropy to environment

**Logical Entropy** (S_logical, measured in QEC code subspace):
- Unitary in code space: ΔS_logical ≈ 0
- Errors/leakage: ΔS_logical > 0
- Depends on error correction success

**For this prediction, we focus on** ***logical entropy*** **in the QEC code subspace,
as it directly correlates with error rates. Simulation studies (Session 2.5) show that
isolating logical entropy changes from duration-dependent effects requires careful
protocol design to avoid multicollinearity.**
```

**Rationale**: Clarifies the three entropy types and specifies which one the prediction concerns.

---

### Revision 3: Update Line 391 (Confound Mitigation)

**BEFORE:**
```
- **Gate time correlations**: ΔS often correlates with gate duration (measurements
  take longer than unitaries). Use fixed-duration protocols or explicitly control
  for duration as C_duration
```

**AFTER:**
```
- **Gate time correlations**: ΔS strongly correlates with gate duration in practice
  (correlation ≥ 0.95 in simulation studies), as measurements both take longer and
  induce more decoherence than unitaries. This creates **fundamental multicollinearity**
  that prevents simple statistical control.

  **Mitigation strategies:**
  1. **Hardware-specific protocols**: Use fixed-duration gates where operations are
     padded to constant time (requires hardware support)
  2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) diagnostics**: Report VIF for all predictors;
     VIF > 10 indicates severe multicollinearity requiring protocol redesign
  3. **Operation-specific noise characterization**: Measure differential decoherence
     rates (measurement vs. unitary operations) to quantify whether ΔS variation
     exists at fixed duration
  4. **Alternative designs**: Consider initial state entropy variation instead of
     operation type (e.g., pure vs. mixed initial states with same circuit)

  **Current status**: Simulation studies find VIF > 10 for standard protocols,
  indicating β may not be identifiable without refined experimental design.
```

**Rationale**: Honest about multicollinearity severity, provides diagnostics and alternatives.

**Experimental Challenges and Current Status**

Recent simulation studies (Session 2.5, October 2025) testing this prediction across
multiple approaches have identified fundamental challenges requiring resolution before
claiming near-term validation:

**Challenge 1: Entropy Definition Ambiguity**
- System, total, and logical entropy behave differently under measurement
- Discrete projective measurements reduce system entropy (ΔS_sys → 0)
- Logical entropy in QEC code subspace can increase with errors
- **Resolution**: Prediction should specify logical subspace entropy explicitly

**Challenge 2: Multicollinearity**
- In standard QEC protocols, ΔS correlates ≥ 0.95 with duration and noise strength
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) > 10 prevents isolating β in regression
- **Root cause**: Longer operations → more decoherence → higher ΔS (fundamental coupling)
- **Resolution**: Requires protocols where ΔS varies independently (e.g., via operation-specific
  noise rates, initial state manipulation, or hardware-supported fixed-duration operations)

**Challenge 3: Simulation Limitations**
- Delay gates break density matrix simulation (cannot measure ΔS during delays)
- Statistical control fails with perfect multicollinearity (VIF = ∞)
- Continuous approximations (Lindblad evolution) don't capture discrete measurement physics
- **Resolution**: Hardware experiments with tomography-based entropy estimation

**Challenge 4: Protocol Specifications**
- "Fixed duration" requires hardware-specific implementations
- Entropy measurement via tomography scales exponentially with qubit count
- Shadow tomography provides efficiency but adds measurement complexity
- **Resolution**: Detailed hardware-specific protocol design (beyond simulation scope)

**Current Testability Assessment**:
- **Simulation validation**: Not achievable with standard approaches (multicollinearity)
- **Hardware validation**: Feasible with refined protocols addressing above challenges
- **Timeline**: Requires protocol development and multi-platform validation (2-5 years)

**Recommendations for Experimental Validation**:
1. **Protocol refinement**: Design hardware-specific tests breaking ΔS-duration coupling
2. **VIF diagnostics**: Report variance inflation factors for all predictors
3. **Multi-platform**: Test across ≥3 qubit modalities to rule out platform-specific artifacts
4. **Staged approach**:
   - Phase 1: Characterize operation-specific noise rates (differential decoherence)
   - Phase 2: Design decorrelated ΔS manipulation protocol
   - Phase 3: Multi-site validation with pre-registered analysis plan

**Honest Assessment**: While LRT's core prediction (β > 0) remains theoretically sound
and falsifiable, experimental validation is more challenging than initially anticipated.
This prediction should be considered a **medium-term research direction** requiring
protocol development, rather than a **near-term validation** on current NISQ hardware
without modification.
```

**Rationale**: Transparent about challenges discovered, provides roadmap for future work.

---

### Revision 5: Update Line 400 (Preliminary Estimates)

**BEFORE:**
```
Based on information-theoretic considerations and preliminary numerical simulations,
we anticipate β ~ 0.1-0.5
```

**AFTER:**
```
Based on information-theoretic considerations, we anticipate β ~ 0.1-0.5
(dimensionless) if measurable. **Note**: Preliminary simulation studies attempting
to validate this range encountered fundamental multicollinearity issues (VIF > 10),
preventing reliable β estimation without protocol refinements. These estimates remain
theoretical pending experimental validation with decorrelated ΔS manipulation.
```

**Rationale**: Doesn't remove the estimate, but acknowledges validation challenges.
