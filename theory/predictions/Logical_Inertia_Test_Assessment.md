# Critical Assessment: Logical Inertia Test (Rabi Oscillation Suppression)

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
**Gemini Proposal**: Idea 2 from alternative prediction analysis

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Test has merit but significant confounds and implementation challenges.

**Key Finding**: This test may suffer from similar issues as the contradiction test - QM *also* predicts deviation from ideal Rabi oscillations at high drive power due to well-known hardware effects. Distinguishing LRT "logical inertia" from QM non-idealities will be extremely challenging.

**Recommendation**: **Deprioritize** relative to Idea 1. Only pursue if Idea 1 fails or after successful theoretical clarification of LRT predictions.

## Proposed Test Design (from Gemini)

### Concept

**Hypothesis**: LRT's Non-Contradiction filtering creates "inertia" against rapid logical state changes, suppressing Rabi oscillations at extreme drive power.

**Circuit**:
```
|0⟩ ── X(θ=Ωt) ── Measure
```

**Experimental Design**:
1. Fix Rabi pulse duration (t)
2. Vary drive power (Ω) from low to extreme
3. Measure population oscillation amplitude vs Ω
4. Compare to QM prediction (should be constant)
5. Look for LRT-predicted suppression at high Ω

**LRT Prediction**: Oscillation amplitude decreases at high Ω (rapid transitions violate NC filtering)

**QM Prediction**: Oscillation amplitude constant (unitary evolution, no suppression)

## Critical Analysis

### ✓ Strengths

1. **Single Circuit Type**: Uses identical X-gate circuit across all measurements
   - Avoids multicollinearity issue from contradiction test
   - VIF = 1.0 (single continuous predictor: Ω)

2. **Continuous Parameter**: Drive power Ω is continuously variable
   - Enables statistical modeling: amplitude = f(Ω)
   - Clear functional form testable

3. **Quantitative Prediction**: LRT predicts measurable deviation (suppression) vs QM baseline

4. **Simple Implementation**: Rabi experiments are standard quantum hardware characterization

### ⚠️ Critical Issues

#### Issue 1: QM Also Predicts Deviations at High Power

**THE FATAL FLAW**: Ideal QM predicts constant amplitude, but *real* QM with hardware effects predicts suppression at high Ω.

**Known QM mechanisms that cause high-power suppression**:

1. **Stark Shift**: Off-resonance drive causes AC Stark shift
   - Effective detuning increases with Ω
   - Suppresses oscillation amplitude
   - Well-characterized QM effect

2. **Bloch-Siegert Shift**: Counter-rotating terms become significant at high Ω
   - Rotating wave approximation breaks down
   - Causes deviation from ideal Rabi formula
   - Standard QM phenomenon

3. **Leakage to Non-Computational States**: High power excites qutrit levels
   - Superconducting qubits are anharmonic oscillators
   - |2⟩ state becomes populated at high drive
   - Reduces |0⟩↔|1⟩ oscillation visibility
   - Pure QM effect (no LRT needed)

4. **Multi-Photon Processes**: At high Ω, multi-photon transitions dominate
   - Deviates from simple Rabi model
   - Standard QM perturbation theory

5. **Pulse Distortion**: Hardware can't deliver ideal rectangular pulses at extreme power
   - AWG bandwidth limitations
   - Signal chain saturation
   - Slew rate limits

**Implication**: Distinguishing LRT "logical inertia" from QM non-idealities requires:
- Precise modeling of all 5 effects above
- Demonstration that observed deviation *exceeds* QM predictions
- This is MUCH harder than the test appears

#### Issue 2: No Clear LRT Quantitative Prediction

**Problem**: What functional form does LRT predict for amplitude vs Ω?

**Possibilities**:
- Exponential suppression: A(Ω) = A₀ exp(-Ω/Ω_LRT)?
- Power law: A(Ω) = A₀ (Ω₀/Ω)^α?
- Step function: A(Ω) = A₀ for Ω < Ω_c, 0 for Ω > Ω_c?
- Logarithmic: A(Ω) = A₀ (1 - β log(Ω/Ω₀))?

**Without a specific functional form**, we can only look for "any deviation from QM" - but QM *already predicts* deviation!

**Gemini did not specify**: What is the LRT model? How does NC filtering translate to Ω-dependent suppression?

#### Issue 3: Baseline Model Complexity

**QM Baseline requires modeling**:
- Anharmonicity (ω₁₂ - ω₀₁)
- AC Stark shift
- Bloch-Siegert shift
- Leakage dynamics (3-level system)
- Pulse shape effects

**This is NOT a simple exponential fit** like the T2 test. Requires:
- Multi-level Lindblad master equation
- Numerical pulse simulation
- Calibrated hardware parameters

**Complexity**: 10× harder analysis than T2 test.

#### Issue 4: Hardware Calibration Requirements

**To test this properly, need**:
1. **Precise qubit anharmonicity measurement**: α = (ω₁₂ - ω₀₁)/2π
2. **Drive frequency calibration**: Must be on-resonance to avoid trivial detuning effects
3. **Power calibration**: Convert AWG voltage to actual Rabi frequency Ω
4. **Pulse shape characterization**: Know actual delivered waveform
5. **|2⟩ state population measurement**: Requires multi-level readout or tomography

**Current IBM Quantum Open Plan**: Does NOT provide access to:
- Detailed qubit parameters (anharmonicity not in backend.properties())
- Low-level pulse control (requires Qiskit Pulse, premium feature)
- Multi-level readout (only |0⟩/|1⟩ discrimination)

**Implication**: Cannot execute this test on free tier. Requires premium access + custom pulse programming.

#### Issue 5: Statistical Power

**Effect size**: How large is LRT suppression predicted to be?
- If 1% deviation: Need ultra-high precision (>>10,000 shots per point)
- If 10% deviation: More feasible but conflicts with "subtle" nature of LRT

**Gemini did not specify**: What magnitude of suppression does LRT predict?

**Without magnitude estimate**: Cannot design experiment (don't know required shot count, Ω range, etc.)

### ❌ Comparison to "No Actualized Contradictions" Test

**Similar Issue**: Both tests suffer from "QM also predicts the effect"

**Contradiction Test**:
- LRT: NC filtering suppresses contradictions
- QM: Unitary evolution + Born rule also suppresses contradictions
- **Result**: Indistinguishable

**Logical Inertia Test**:
- LRT: NC filtering suppresses high-Ω oscillations
- QM: Stark shift + leakage + Bloch-Siegert also suppress high-Ω oscillations
- **Result**: VERY HARD to distinguish (not impossible, but requires heroic modeling)

**Key Difference**: Contradiction test was *logically* indistinguishable. Inertia test is *quantitatively* distinguishable but *practically* very difficult.

## Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Feasibility: ⚠️ MODERATE TO LOW

**Requirements**:
- ✓ Rabi experiment is standard (easy)
- ✗ Requires pulse-level control (premium feature)
- ✗ Requires multi-level modeling (complex)
- ✗ Requires precise hardware calibration (may not be provided)
- ⚠️ Requires high shot counts (expensive)

**Estimated Resources**:
- **Quantum Time**: ~30-60 minutes (similar to T2 test)
- **Access Tier**: Enhanced + Pulse Access (not available on Open Plan)
- **Analysis Complexity**: HIGH (multi-level dynamics, pulse simulation)
- **Personnel Time**: 2-4 weeks (modeling + implementation + analysis)

### Scientific Feasibility: ⚠️ MODERATE

**Can we distinguish LRT from QM?**
- **Theoretically**: Yes, if LRT suppression exceeds known QM effects
- **Practically**: Requires precise modeling of 5+ QM confounds
- **Challenge**: LRT prediction magnitude unknown (can't estimate required precision)

**Compared to T2 Test**:
| Aspect | T2 Test | Rabi Inertia Test |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Circuit complexity | Simple | Simple |
| Baseline model | Single exponential | Multi-level dynamics |
| Confounds | Few (1/f noise, T1) | Many (Stark, leakage, Bloch-Siegert, pulse, anharmonicity) |
| Calibration needs | Minimal | Extensive |
| Analysis difficulty | LOW | HIGH |
| QM vs LRT separation | Clear (exponential decay) | Ambiguous (both predict suppression) |

**Assessment**: Much harder than T2 test, less likely to yield clear results.

## Comparison to Idea 1 (Logical State-Dependent Error)

| Criterion | Idea 1 (T1 vs T2) | Idea 2 (Rabi Inertia) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Avoids A/B circuit trap?** | Yes (identical circuits) | Yes (identical circuits) |
| **Single continuous parameter?** | Yes (time T) | Yes (power Ω) |
| **LRT vs QM distinguishable?** | **YES** (QM: T1=T2, LRT: T2<T1) | **AMBIGUOUS** (both predict suppression) |
| **Confounds** | Few (drift, crosstalk) | Many (Stark, leakage, pulse) |
| **Baseline model** | Two exponentials | Multi-level dynamics |
| **Implementation** | Standard | Requires pulse control |
| **Access tier** | Enhanced (standard) | Enhanced + Pulse |
| **Analysis complexity** | MODERATE | HIGH |
| **LRT prediction clarity** | Clear (T2/T1 ratio) | **Unclear** (no functional form given) |

**VERDICT**: **Idea 1 is significantly superior** to Idea 2.

**Why**:
1. **Clear LRT prediction**: T2 < T1 (superposition less stable)
2. **QM prediction differs**: T2 = T1 (no preference)
3. **Fewer confounds**: Only drift and crosstalk
4. **Simpler implementation**: No pulse programming needed
5. **Easier analysis**: Two independent exponential fits

**Idea 2 suffers from**:
1. QM *also* predicts high-Ω suppression (multiple mechanisms)
2. No specific LRT functional form provided
3. Requires heroic modeling to separate LRT from QM effects
4. Needs premium pulse access (not just enhanced access)

## Conclusion

**Idea 2 (Logical Inertia via Rabi suppression) has merit but significant challenges:**

✓ **Pros**:
- Avoids A/B circuit comparison trap (single circuit type)
- Uses continuous parameter (Ω)
- Conceptually simple (Rabi oscillations are standard)
- Testable in principle

✗ **Cons**:
- **QM also predicts suppression at high Ω** (Stark, leakage, Bloch-Siegert)
- No specific LRT functional form provided (can't design experiment)
- Complex baseline model required (multi-level dynamics)
- Requires premium pulse access (not available on Open Plan)
- HIGH analysis complexity (harder than T2 test)
- **Ambiguous LRT vs QM separation** (both predict same qualitative behavior)

**Recommendation**: **Deprioritize** relative to Idea 1.

**Rationale**:
- Idea 1 (T1 vs T2) has clear LRT prediction (T2 < T1) that differs from QM (T2 = T1)
- Idea 2 has ambiguous prediction (both LRT and QM predict suppression)
- Idea 1 requires simpler analysis and fewer confounds
- Idea 2 requires pulse-level access and heroic modeling

**If user insists on Idea 2**: First complete theoretical work to derive:
1. Specific A(Ω) functional form
2. Effect magnitude estimate
3. Comparison to known QM effects (Stark, leakage, etc.)

**Better alternatives**:
1. **Theoretical clarification**: Does LRT differ from QM at all?
2. **Pursue Idea 1**: T1 vs T2 comparison (cleaner test)
3. **Scale T2 test**: Validate methodology works at higher precision

---

**Assessment Status**: PRELIMINARY - Requires theoretical input from LRT framework

**Next Step**: Decide between theoretical clarification vs experimental test (Idea 1 vs Idea 2 vs scale T2)

**Key Insight**: Like the contradiction test, Idea 2 may be another case where LRT and QM predict similar qualitative behavior, making experimental distinction extremely challenging.
