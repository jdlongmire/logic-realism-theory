## Implementation Plan for Full-Scale Test

### Step 1: Acquire Enhanced Access

**Application Materials**:
- ✓ Validated methodology (Phases 1-4 complete)
- ✓ Proof-of-concept results
- ✓ Published analysis code and data
- ✓ Clear scientific objectives
- ✓ Resource requirements quantified

**Justification**:
"Proof-of-concept on ibm_torino validated methodology. Request enhanced access to execute full-scale design (1M shots across 3-5 backends) for comprehensive LRT testing."

### Step 2: Backend Selection

**Criteria**:
- T2 coherence time >100 µs
- Baseline error rate <5%
- Calibration data available
- Multiple backends for cross-validation

**Recommended Backends** (as of 2025):
- IBM Quantum Heron processors (premium tier)
- IBM Quantum Eagle processors (127 qubits)
- Multiple instances for hardware comparison

### Step 3: Experiment Execution

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks (including queue wait, multiple runs)

**Workflow**:
1. **Week 1**: Single backend, T2 experiment (49 points × 10,000 shots)
2. **Week 2**: Same backend, T1 experiment (49 points × 10,000 shots)
3. **Week 3**: Repeat on 2nd backend for cross-validation
4. **Week 4**: 3rd backend (if budget allows) + analysis

**Automation**: All scripts ready (`run_hardware_test.py`, `analyze_hardware_results.py`)

### Step 4: Analysis & Publication

**Analysis** (1-2 weeks):
- Statistical framework already validated
- Compare results across backends
- Check for systematic deviations from QM
- Power analysis for null results

**Publication** (2-4 weeks):
- Methodology paper (validated experimental design)
- Results paper (comprehensive LRT test)
- All data publicly available (reproducibility)

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: LRT Signal Detected (p < 0.05)

**Implications**:
- New physics beyond standard QM
- Requires verification on additional backends
- Independent replication essential
- Major physics result

**Follow-up**:
- Characterize signal magnitude and dependence
- Test other observables (entanglement, etc.)
- Theoretical refinement of LRT predictions
- Publish in high-impact physics journal

### Scenario 2: No LRT Signal (p > 0.05)

**Implications**:
- Either LRT = QM (reinterpretation) or effect <1%
- Still scientifically valuable (rules out large deviations)
- Methodology contribution (other theories can use)

**Follow-up**:
- Test alternative observables
- Increase precision (if possible)
- Theoretical work: Does LRT make any distinct predictions?
- Publish methodology + negative result (important for field)

### Scenario 3: Inconclusive (borderline significance)

**Implications**:
- Need more data or different approach
- Possibly hardware-limited (noise floor)

**Follow-up**:
- Repeat with higher shot counts
- Try different backends/observables
- Wait for better hardware (future)

## Resource Estimates

### Quantum Time Budget

**Per Backend**:
- T2 experiment: 49 points × 10,000 shots × ~7 sec = ~3.5 hours
- T1 experiment: 49 points × 10,000 shots × ~7 sec = ~3.5 hours
- **Total per backend**: ~7 hours

**Multiple Backends** (3 total):
- 3 backends × 7 hours = **21 hours quantum time**
- Plus calibration, queue wait, repeats: **~30-40 hours total**

**Enhanced Access Needed**: Researchers/Educators Program (100+ hours/month typical)

### Cost Estimate (if using cloud credits)

- IBM Quantum Cloud: ~$1.60/minute for premium backends
- 30 hours = 1,800 minutes × $1.60 = **~$2,900** (rough estimate)

**Alternative**: Free enhanced access via Researchers/Educators Program (recommended)

### Personnel Time

- Experiment execution: 2-4 weeks (mostly queue wait, automated scripts)
- Analysis: 1-2 weeks (framework already built)
- Publication writing: 2-4 weeks
- **Total project duration**: 2-3 months from enhanced access approval
