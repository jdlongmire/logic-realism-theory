# Test Design: "No Actualized Contradictions" Prediction

**Session**: 2.6 (continuation of 2.5)
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Phase 1 - Protocol Design (NO CODE YET)

---

## Lesson from Session 2.5

**CRITICAL**: Session 2.5 wrote ~3,500 lines of code across 8 files before discovering fundamental design flaws (multicollinearity, wrong entropy type, duration confounds). This cost significant time and produced no valid results.

**New Methodology** (from Gemini consultation):
1. **Phase 1**: Rigorous protocol design (identify confounds, create statistical model)
2. **Phase 2**: Minimal implementation with VIF diagnostics
3. **Phase 3**: Full simulation (ONLY after design validated)
4. **Phase 4**: Documentation

**This document is Phase 1**: No code will be written until this design is validated.

## Part 1: Define the Testable Hypothesis

### LRT's Prediction (from paper lines 299, 423-437)

**The Claim**: "LRT predicts that NC forbids actualized contradictions regardless of energy scale. If reproducible contradiction (not superposition, not measurement error) appears in quantum computers, LRT is falsified."

### Question 1: What *exactly* constitutes a "contradiction" in this context?

**Need to distinguish**:
- ❌ **NOT a contradiction**: Superposition states like (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2 (allowed by QM)
- ❌ **NOT a contradiction**: Measurement uncertainty (inherent to QM)
- ❌ **NOT a contradiction**: Decoherence causing mixed states
- ✅ **IS a contradiction**: A stable, actualized record showing P ∧ ¬P simultaneously

**Candidate definitions**:

**Option A: Self-Referential Paradox Encoding**
- Circuit attempts to encode: "This qubit's measurement outcome is 0 if and only if it's 1"
- Classical version: Liar paradox ("This statement is false")
- Quantum encoding: Use feedback from measurement to control preparation

**Option B: Incompatible Observable Actualization**
- Circuit attempts to prepare eigenstate of both X and Z (incompatible observables)
- LRT prediction: NC prevents stable records showing both |+⟩_X and |0⟩_Z
- Standard QM: Uncertainty principle prevents this, but through mechanism, not logic

**Option C: Constraint Violation Persistence**
- Circuit attempts to maintain record violating Bell inequality classically
- LRT: NC prevents stable classical records violating local realism constraints
- Standard QM: Already predicts this (no local hidden variables)

**Option D: Measurement Record Inconsistency**
- Circuit creates measurement record claiming: "Qubit measured as 0 AND measured as 1"
- LRT: NC prevents both records from actualizing simultaneously
- Implementation: Measure qubit, store result, re-measure, check consistency

### Question 2: How do we *engineer* a circuit that attempts to force a contradiction?

**Proposal (based on Option D - most testable)**:

```
Protocol: "Contradiction Attempt via Double Measurement"

1. Prepare qubit in |0⟩
2. Apply X gate → |1⟩
3. Measure in Z basis → Record R1 (should be |1⟩)
4. [Control decision point]
   - If R1 = 1: Do nothing (qubit is |1⟩)
   - If R1 = 0: This is already wrong (noise/error)
5. Apply X gate → Should flip to |0⟩
6. Measure in Z basis → Record R2 (should be |0⟩)
7. Check: Does (R1 = 1 AND R2 = 1) ever occur?

Contradiction attempt: Use conditional gates to try forcing both records to same value
```

**Better approach - Self-reference**:

```
Protocol: "Liar Paradox Circuit"

Attempt to encode: "My measurement outcome is NOT what it actually is"

1. Prepare qubit in superposition |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
2. Measure in Z basis → Record R
3. Apply conditional flip based on R:
   - If R = 0: Apply X (try to make it "should have been 1")
   - If R = 1: Do nothing (claim it "should have been 0")
4. Re-measure → Record R'
5. Check: Does (R = 0 AND R' = 0) occur? (Contradiction: flipped but stayed same)
```

**Issue**: This is just testing measurement + conditional gate + re-measurement. Not a true paradox.

**Alternative - Stronger Contradiction Attempt**:

```
Protocol: "Bidirectional Conditioning"

1. Prepare two qubits: A, B in |00⟩
2. Apply: CNOT(A→B) and CNOT(B→A) (mutual conditioning)
3. Measure both
4. Check if results violate causal consistency

Expected: Decoherence prevents stable inconsistency
LRT claim: NC actively filters this (not just decoherence)
Challenge: How to distinguish NC filtering from decoherence?
```

### Question 3: What is the *predicted observable outcome*?

**This is critical**: What does LRT predict differently from standard QM?

**Standard QM prediction**:
- Contradictory states don't appear because of unitary evolution + measurement postulates
- No *mechanism* - just "these aren't allowed states"
- Decoherence prevents macroscopic superpositions

**LRT prediction**:
- NC actively filters information space
- Contradictions are suppressed even if circuit attempts to force them
- Should see suppression BEYOND what decoherence alone predicts?

**THE PROBLEM**: How do we distinguish?
- If contradiction doesn't appear: Both QM and LRT predict this
- If contradiction appears: Both theories are falsified (NC violation)
- We need a regime where QM allows something LRT forbids

**Potential differentiator**:
- **Error rates**: Do "contradiction-attempting" circuits have higher error rates than matched controls?
- **Timescales**: Does suppression happen faster than decoherence timescale?
- **Scaling**: Does suppression strengthen with system size differently than decoherence?

**Proposed observable**:

```
Compare two circuit classes:
1. "Contradiction-attempting" circuits (self-referential, paradoxical logic)
2. "Control" circuits (same duration, gates, noise, but no paradoxical structure)

Measure:
- Error rate in maintaining target state
- Decoherence rate
- Leakage out of computational basis

Hypothesis:
- LRT predicts: Contradiction circuits have HIGHER error rates than controls
  (NC actively filters them)
- Standard QM: Error rates should be SAME (just decoherence, no logic-awareness)

Statistical test:
- error_rate_contradiction > error_rate_control (beyond what duration/noise predicts)
```

**Critical issue**: This is similar to our QEC test - comparing two circuit types. Risk of confounds!

## Part 2: Identify All Confounds

### Confound 1: Decoherence (The Obvious One)

**The Problem**: Any circuit will decohere. How do we know if state suppression is due to:
- NC actively filtering (LRT claim)
- Just normal decoherence (standard QM)

**Potential Solutions**:
- ❌ **"Control for decoherence time"**: This was our Session 2.5 failure
- ✅ **Match total duration exactly**: Use padding/delays (but Test 4 showed this breaks entropy measurement)
- ✅ **Statistical control**: Include T1, T2 as covariates (but multicollinearity risk)
- ✅ **Look for anomalies**: NC might suppress FASTER than T1/T2 predict

**Design requirement**:
- Contradiction and control circuits must have IDENTICAL duration
- If padding needed, must not break state measurement
- VIF(contradiction_flag, duration) must be < 5

### Confound 2: Duration (The Killer from Session 2.5)

**The Problem**: If contradiction circuits take longer than controls:
- They decohere more → Higher error rates
- We see correlation, but it's spurious (duration proxy)
- VIF = ∞ (perfect multicollinearity)

**From Test 3 (Session 2.5)**:
- Measurement-heavy: 25.0 μs, p_log = 0.1528
- Unitary-only: 14.6 μs, p_log = 0.0624
- Difference: 10.4 μs (2.45x error rate)
- VIF: ∞ (perfect correlation)

**Solution**:
- **REQUIREMENT**: Contradiction and control circuits MUST have identical gate count and duration
- Design circuits in pairs: Same operations, different logical structure
- Example:
  - Contradiction: Measure → Conditional flip → Re-measure
  - Control: Measure → Unconditional flip → Re-measure
  - Same gates, same duration, different logic

### Confound 3: Noise Channel Specificity

**The Problem**: What if "contradiction structure" just happens to amplify a specific noise channel?
- Not NC filtering, just noise susceptibility
- Example: Conditional gates more susceptible to crosstalk

**From Test 2 (Session 2.5)**:
- Higher noise → Higher ΔS AND higher p_phys (spurious correlation)
- VIF = 11.2

**Solution**:
- Test across multiple noise models (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping)
- If NC filtering is real, should be consistent across noise types
- If noise-specific, it's just susceptibility, not filtering

### Confound 4: Circuit Depth / Complexity

**The Problem**: Contradiction circuits might just be more complex
- More gates → More errors
- Not NC filtering, just error accumulation

**Solution**:
- Match gate count exactly between contradiction and control
- Use circuit depth as covariate
- Check VIF(contradiction_flag, gate_count)

### Confound 5: Measurement Overhead

**The Problem**: Contradiction circuits might require more measurements
- Measurements induce decoherence (2-5x higher rates, from Session 2.5)
- Back to measurement-heavy vs unitary-only (Test 3 failure)

**Solution**:
- Match measurement count exactly
- Both contradiction and control have same number of measurement operations

## Part 3: Create the Statistical Model

### Regression Model

```
log(p_error) = α + β_contradiction * I_contradiction
               + β_duration * duration
               + β_gates * gate_count
               + β_meas * n_measurements
               + β_T1 * (1/T1)
               + β_T2 * (1/T2)
               + ε
```

Where:
- `I_contradiction`: Binary indicator (1 = contradiction circuit, 0 = control)
- `duration`: Total circuit time (μs)
- `gate_count`: Number of gates
- `n_measurements`: Number of measurement operations
- `T1, T2`: Decoherence parameters

**LRT prediction**: β_contradiction > 0 (contradiction circuits have higher errors)
**Null hypothesis**: β_contradiction = 0 (no difference beyond controls)

### Design Requirements to Avoid Multicollinearity

**Critical constraints**:
1. **Duration must be constant**: All circuits (contradiction and control) have IDENTICAL duration
   - This makes β_duration unidentifiable, but removes confound
   - Alternative: Vary duration systematically, ensure correlation(I_contradiction, duration) < 0.3

2. **Gate count must be constant**: All circuits have IDENTICAL gate count
   - Or: Match gate types exactly (same number of X, H, CNOT, etc.)

3. **Measurement count must be constant**: All circuits have IDENTICAL measurement count

4. **Noise parameters vary**: Run multiple trials with different T1, T2 to break correlation

**VIF Diagnostic**:
```python
# After generating test data, check:
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

vif_contradiction = VIF(I_contradiction)
vif_duration = VIF(duration)

# REQUIREMENT: All VIF < 5 (ideally < 3)
# If any VIF > 5: STOP, redesign protocol
```

### Experimental Design Matrix

**Proposed design**:

| Circuit Type | Duration | Gates | Measurements | Paradox Structure |
|--------------|----------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Contradiction 1 | 10 μs | 5 | 2 | Self-referential (Liar) |
| Control 1 | 10 μs | 5 | 2 | Linear (no feedback) |
| Contradiction 2 | 10 μs | 5 | 2 | Mutual condition (A↔B) |
| Control 2 | 10 μs | 5 | 2 | One-way (A→B only) |
| Contradiction 3 | 20 μs | 10 | 4 | Complex self-ref |
| Control 3 | 20 μs | 10 | 4 | Complex linear |

**Vary across trials**:
- T1: [50 μs, 100 μs, 200 μs]
- T2: [25 μs, 50 μs, 100 μs]
- Noise strength: [0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%]

**Fixed within trial**:
- Duration (within each pair)
- Gate count (within each pair)
- Measurement count (within each pair)

This ensures:
- Correlation(I_contradiction, duration) = 0 (perfectly balanced)
- Correlation(I_contradiction, gate_count) = 0
- Variation in T1, T2, noise breaks multicollinearity with those factors

## Part 4: Predicted Outcomes

### Scenario 1: LRT is Correct (NC Filtering Exists)

**Prediction**:
- β_contradiction > 0 (significantly, p < 0.05)
- Contradiction circuits have 10-50% higher error rates than matched controls
- Effect persists across noise models
- Effect scales with "paradox strength" (self-ref > mutual > simple)

**Observable signature**:
- Error rate increase beyond what duration/gates/measurements predict
- VIF < 5 (confounds controlled)
- Consistent across T1, T2 variations

### Scenario 2: Standard QM (No NC Filtering)

**Prediction**:
- β_contradiction ≈ 0 (not significant)
- Error rates explained entirely by duration, gates, measurements
- No special suppression of "paradoxical" structures

**Observable signature**:
- P-value > 0.05 for β_contradiction
- R² doesn't improve by adding I_contradiction term

### Scenario 3: Design Flawed (Confounded)

**Prediction**:
- β_contradiction appears significant BUT
- VIF > 5 (multicollinearity detected)
- Effect disappears when proper controls added
- THIS is what happened in Session 2.5

**Observable signature**:
- High VIF scores
- β_contradiction changes drastically when adding/removing covariates
- Correlation matrix shows high correlations between predictors

## Part 5: Open Questions (Need to Resolve Before Phase 2)

### Question 1: What IS a "contradiction circuit" operationally?

**Current candidates**:
1. **Self-referential measurement**: Measure → Condition on result → Flip based on result → Re-measure
2. **Mutual conditioning**: Two qubits condition on each other simultaneously
3. **Retrocausal attempt**: Use measurement result to "change" preparation (classical feedback)

**Need to decide**: Which one(s) are:
- Clearly "paradoxical" in LRT framework
- Implementable in Qiskit with exact control matching
- Different enough from standard circuits to matter

### Question 2: How do we match duration EXACTLY?

**Options**:
- **Gate padding**: Add identity gates (but they cause decoherence!)
- **Delay instructions**: Use `qc.delay()` (but Test 4 showed this breaks density matrix)
- **Fixed gate sequences**: Design circuits with identical gate lists, different order/conditioning

**From Session 2.5 Test 4**:
- Delay gates → Density matrix simulation fails
- Identity gates → Accumulate decoherence (not truly "fixed duration")

**Proposed solution**:
- Use identical gate sequences, vary only the conditioning logic
- Example: Both circuits do [Measure, X, Measure], but contradiction uses `c_if`, control uses `c_x` unconditionally

### Question 3: Is this even testing LRT vs QM?

**Fundamental concern**: Both LRT and QM forbid contradictions. So what are we testing?

**Possible answer 1**: LRT provides a *mechanism* (NC filtering), QM just postulates it
- But observationally, they're identical
- Not a falsifiable difference

**Possible answer 2**: LRT predicts STRONGER suppression in specific regimes
- Maybe NC filtering is faster than decoherence
- Look for "too fast" decay in contradiction circuits

**Possible answer 3**: This is more about validating LRT's framework internally
- Show that NC does what it claims (prevents contradictions)
- Even if QM also predicts this, it validates LRT's mechanism

**Need to clarify**: What exactly would falsify LRT here?
- Option A: If contradictions DO appear → LRT falsified (and QM too!)
- Option B: If contradictions DON'T appear, but at same rate as decoherence → No evidence for NC filtering beyond standard physics
- Option C: If contradictions suppressed FASTER than decoherence → Evidence for NC filtering

**I think we're testing Option C**: Does NC filtering provide *additional* suppression beyond decoherence?

**NO CODE WRITTEN**: This is intentional. Session 2.5 taught us to validate design first.
