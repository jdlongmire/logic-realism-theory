**Author**: James D. (JD) Longmire
**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Purpose**: Derive quantitative predictions for experimental tests from LRT axioms
**Status**: Theoretical derivation for Paths 3 and 5

---

## Executive Summary

This document derives quantitative predictions for two key experimental tests:
1. **Path 3 (T1 vs T2)**: Predicted T2/T1 ratio from constraint thermodynamics
2. **Path 5 (Frequency Shift)**: Predicted δω from state-dependent Hamiltonian

**Key Result**: LRT predicts **T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9** (10-30% faster superposition decoherence) and **δω/ω ≈ 10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³** (frequency shift from logical status).

**Critical Caveat**: These predictions involve free parameters (constraint weights) that require empirical calibration. The derivations establish functional forms and order-of-magnitude estimates, not exact numerical values.

## 1. Theoretical Framework Review

### 1.1 Core LRT Axioms

From `Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 3):

1. **Axiom of Infinite Space (I)**: Unbounded informational substrate with maximum entropy S(I)
2. **Axiom of Logical Operators (L)**: Three constraints
   - **Id (Identity)**: Persistence and self-sameness
   - **NC (Non-Contradiction)**: Incompatible states cannot coexist
   - **EM (Excluded Middle)**: Binary resolution of indeterminate states
3. **Axiom of Actualization (A)**: A = L(I), entropy-reducing process S(A) < S(I)

### 1.2 Quantum State Ontology

**Superposition** (e.g., |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2):
- **Constraints Active**: Id + NC (2 of 3)
- **Constraint Relaxed**: EM (no binary resolution)
- **Entropy**: S(superposition) > S(classical)
- **Status**: Partially constrained (physically real but indeterminate)

**Classical State** (e.g., |0⟩ or |1⟩):
- **Constraints Active**: Id + NC + EM (3 of 3)
- **Entropy**: S(classical) < S(superposition)
- **Status**: Fully constrained (physically real and determinate)

**Key Insight**: Superposition has HIGHER entropy than classical states because it lacks the EM constraint. By thermodynamic principles, higher entropy states are less stable.

### 1.3 Energy-Entropy Relationship

From `Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 3.3):

**Landauer's Principle** (single-bit erasure):
```
E_min = k_B T ln(2)
```

**Spohn's Inequality** (general entropy production):
```
D(ρ_t || ρ_eq) - D(ρ₀ || ρ_eq) ≤ -β ∫ Q_t dt
```
where β = 1/(k_B T), D is relative entropy, Q_t is heat flow.

**LRT Connection**: Energy emerges as the thermodynamic measure of constraint application. More constraints → lower entropy → higher stability.

## 2. Path 3: T1 vs T2 Decoherence Ratio

### 2.1 Physical Setup

**T1 (Amplitude Relaxation)**:
- Measures: Decay of classical state |1⟩ → |0⟩
- Process: Energy dissipation to environment
- Constraints: Full (Id + NC + EM)

**T2 (Phase Coherence)**:
- Measures: Decay of superposition |+⟩ → mixed state
- Process: Phase information loss (pure dephasing)
- Constraints: Partial (Id + NC only, EM relaxed)

### 2.2 Constraint Thermodynamics Derivation

**Assumption 1**: Each constraint contributes to state stability against thermal fluctuations.

**Assumption 2**: Decoherence rate Γ (inverse lifetime) depends on entropy barrier to degradation:
```
Γ ∝ exp(-ΔS_barrier / k_B)
```
where ΔS_barrier is the entropic cost of overcoming constraints.

**Model 1: Equal Constraint Weights**

If each constraint (Id, NC, EM) contributes equally to stability:
- Classical barrier: ΔS_1 = 3 * S_constraint
- Superposition barrier: ΔS_2 = 2 * S_constraint (missing EM)

Ratio:
```
T2/T1 = Γ_1/Γ_2 = exp((ΔS_1 - ΔS_2)/k_B) = exp(S_constraint/k_B)
```

If S_constraint ≈ k_B ln(3/2):
```
T2/T1 = exp(ln(3/2)) = 3/2 ≈ 0.67
```

**Predicted**: T2 is 33% shorter than T1 (faster decoherence for superposition).

**Model 2: Weighted Constraints**

More realistically, constraints may have different "strengths" or "costs":
```
ΔS_1 = w_Id * S_Id + w_NC * S_NC + w_EM * S_EM
ΔS_2 = w_Id * S_Id + w_NC * S_NC
```

Ratio:
```
T2/T1 = exp((ΔS_1 - ΔS_2)/k_B) = exp(w_EM * S_EM / k_B)
```

This introduces a free parameter: **w_EM * S_EM** (EM constraint cost).

**Parametric Range**:
- **Weak EM** (w_EM * S_EM ≈ 0.1 k_B): T2/T1 ≈ 0.90 (10% reduction)
- **Moderate EM** (w_EM * S_EM ≈ 0.4 k_B): T2/T1 ≈ 0.67 (33% reduction)
- **Strong EM** (w_EM * S_EM ≈ 0.7 k_B): T2/T1 ≈ 0.50 (50% reduction)

### 2.3 Quantitative Prediction

**LRT Prediction (Path 3)**:
```
T2 < T1

Predicted range: T2/T1 ∈ [0.5, 0.95]
Best estimate:    T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 (10-30% reduction)
```

**Justification**:
- Lower bound (0.5): Strong EM constraint
- Upper bound (0.95): Weak EM constraint
- Best estimate (0.7-0.9): Moderate EM, consistent with constraint hierarchy

**Free Parameter**: EM constraint weight (w_EM * S_EM) - requires empirical calibration

**QM Prediction**: T2 ≈ T1 (no fundamental state preference)

**Statistical Requirement**: To detect 10% difference (T2/T1 = 0.9):
- Need ~0.5% measurement precision
- Requires ~40,000 shots per point (10,000 is marginal)
- Cross-validation on 3 backends essential

### 2.4 Alternative Entropy-Based Derivation

**Superposition Entropy** (1 qubit in |+⟩ state):
```
S(|+⟩) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ) where ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| + |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0|)/2
      = ln(2) ≈ 0.693 (maximum for 1 qubit)
```

**Classical Entropy** (1 qubit in |0⟩ state):
```
S(|0⟩) = -Tr(|0⟩⟨0| ln |0⟩⟨0|) = 0 (perfectly definite)
```

**Entropy Difference**:
```
ΔS = S(|+⟩) - S(|0⟩) = ln(2)
```

**Energy Cost** (from Landauer):
```
ΔE = k_B T * ΔS = k_B T ln(2)
```

**Decoherence Ratio** (Arrhenius form):
```
T2/T1 = exp(-ΔE/k_B T) = exp(-ln(2)) = 1/2 = 0.5
```

This gives T2 = 0.5 * T1 (50% reduction), which is the **lower bound** of our range.

**Interpretation**: This derivation assumes the FULL entropy difference contributes to decoherence, which is maximal. More realistic models (accounting for environmental coupling) give T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9.

### 2.5 Comparison to Standard Quantum Mechanics

**Standard QM Relation**:
```
1/T2 = 1/(2T1) + 1/T2_pure_dephasing
```
where T2_pure_dephasing is additional phase noise.

This gives T2 ≤ 2T1, but typically T2 ≈ T1 in well-isolated qubits.

**LRT Difference**:
LRT predicts T2 < T1 **fundamentally** (not just from environmental noise), because superposition has intrinsically higher entropy due to relaxed EM constraint.

## 3. Path 5: Hamiltonian Frequency Shift

### 3.1 Physical Setup

**Hypothesis**: Superposition states have different Hamiltonian energy than classical states due to logical status.

**Ramsey Measurement**:
- Experiment A: Measure frequency ω₀ of classical state |0⟩
- Experiment B: Measure frequency ω₊ of superposition state |+⟩
- Observable: δω = ω₊ - ω₀

### 3.2 State-Dependent Hamiltonian Derivation

**Hamiltonian in LRT**: Energy operator emerges from Identity constraint (Stone's theorem).

From `Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md`:
```
U(t) = exp(-i H t / ℏ)
```
where H is the self-adjoint generator of time evolution.

**Classical State** (|0⟩):
- Full constraints: Id + NC + EM
- Hamiltonian: H₀ (standard qubit Hamiltonian)
- Frequency: ω₀ = E₀/ℏ

**Superposition State** (|+⟩):
- Partial constraints: Id + NC (EM relaxed)
- Hamiltonian: H₊ = H₀ + ΔH (correction from logical status)
- Frequency: ω₊ = (E₀ + ΔE)/ℏ

**Key Question**: What is ΔH (or ΔE)?

### 3.3 Entropy-Energy Correction

**Entropy Difference** (from Section 2.4):
```
ΔS = S(|+⟩) - S(|0⟩) = ln(2)
```

**Energy Correction** (from Spohn/Landauer):
```
ΔE = k_B T * ΔS = k_B T ln(2)
```

**Frequency Shift**:
```
δω = ω₊ - ω₀ = ΔE/ℏ = (k_B T ln(2))/ℏ
```

**Numerical Estimate** (T = 15 mK, typical superconducting qubit):
```
k_B = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K
T = 0.015 K
ln(2) ≈ 0.693
ℏ = 1.055 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s

δω = (1.38 × 10⁻²³ × 0.015 × 0.693) / (1.055 × 10⁻³⁴)
    ≈ 1.35 × 10⁸ rad/s
    ≈ 21.5 MHz
```

**Relative Shift** (for 5 GHz qubit):
```
δω/ω₀ = 21.5 MHz / 5000 MHz ≈ 4.3 × 10⁻³ ≈ 0.43%
```

### 3.4 Constraint-Weight Model

The above derivation assumes the full entropic cost appears as energy shift. More realistically:

**Parametric Model**:
```
ΔE = α * k_B T ln(2)
```
where α is a dimensionless parameter (0 < α ≤ 1) representing the coupling strength between logical status and Hamiltonian.

**Frequency Shift**:
```
δω = (α * k_B T ln(2)) / ℏ
```

**Parametric Range** (T = 15 mK):
- **Weak coupling** (α = 0.01): δω ≈ 215 kHz, δω/ω₀ ≈ 4.3 × 10⁻⁵
- **Moderate coupling** (α = 0.1): δω ≈ 2.15 MHz, δω/ω₀ ≈ 4.3 × 10⁻⁴
- **Strong coupling** (α = 1.0): δω ≈ 21.5 MHz, δω/ω₀ ≈ 4.3 × 10⁻³

### 3.5 Quantitative Prediction

**LRT Prediction (Path 5)**:
```
ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩)

Predicted range: δω/ω ∈ [10⁻⁵, 10⁻²]
Best estimate:    δω/ω ≈ 10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³ (0.01-0.1%)
```

**Justification**:
- Upper bound (10⁻²): Full entropic cost (α = 1), strong coupling
- Lower bound (10⁻⁵): Weak coupling (α = 0.01)
- Best estimate (10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³): Moderate coupling (α = 0.1-0.5)

**Free Parameter**: Coupling strength α - requires empirical determination

**QM Prediction**: ω(|+⟩) = ω(|0⟩) (energy independent of logical status)

**Measurement Precision**: Ramsey interferometry can achieve 0.01-0.1% precision, making this testable.

### 3.6 Comparison to AC Stark Shift

**AC Stark Shift** (known systematic):
- Frequency shift from drive pulses: δω_Stark ∝ Ω²/Δ
- Typical magnitude: ~kHz-MHz (state-dependent)
- **Confound**: Must be calibrated and subtracted

**LRT Shift** (fundamental):
- Frequency shift from logical status: δω_LRT = α * k_B T ln(2) / ℏ
- Predicted magnitude: ~100 kHz - 10 MHz (T = 15 mK)
- **Signature**: Temperature-dependent (δω ∝ T)

**Distinguishing**: Use temperature sweep (vary T from 10 mK to 100 mK):
- AC Stark: Temperature-independent
- LRT: δω ∝ T (linear scaling)

## 4. Summary of Quantitative Predictions

| **Free Parameter** | EM constraint weight | None | Calibrate |

**Experimental Signature**:
- Systematic T2 < T1 across multiple qubits
- Ratio T2/T1 ≈ 0.7-0.9 consistently
- Cross-backend validation essential

### 4.2 Path 5 (Frequency Shift)

| Prediction | LRT | QM | Testable? |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| **Relation** | ω(|+⟩) ≠ ω(|0⟩) | ω(|+⟩) = ω(|0⟩) | Yes |
| **Magnitude** | δω/ω ≈ 10⁻⁴ - 10⁻³ | δω/ω = 0 | Yes |
| **Precision Required** | ~0.01-0.1% | N/A | Achievable |
| **Free Parameter** | Coupling α | None | Calibrate |
| **Temperature Dependence** | δω ∝ T | None | Strong signature |

**Experimental Signature**:
- Measurable frequency difference δω ≈ 0.1-10 MHz
- Linear scaling with temperature
- Distinct from AC Stark shift (T-independent)

### 4.3 Free Parameters and Falsifiability

**Critical Acknowledgment**: Both predictions involve free parameters:
- **Path 3**: EM constraint weight (w_EM)
- **Path 5**: Coupling strength (α)

**Scientific Status**:
- ✅ **Functional forms derived** from LRT first principles
- ✅ **Order-of-magnitude estimates** provided
- ✅ **Testable predictions** (T2 < T1, ω₊ ≠ ω₀)
- ⚠️ **Exact numerical values** require empirical calibration

**Falsifiability**:
- **Path 3 falsified if**: T2 ≥ T1 systematically (no EM constraint cost)
- **Path 5 falsified if**: δω = 0 within measurement precision (no logical-status coupling)
- **Both paths falsified if**: Results match QM with no detectable LRT signature

**Unfalsifiable case**: If experiments show T2 ≈ 0.99*T1 or δω ≈ 10⁻⁶, one could claim "weak coupling" or "small EM weight." This is a legitimate concern that requires:
1. **Independent measurement** of free parameters (e.g., via other observables)
2. **Consistency checks** across multiple experimental setups
3. **Theoretical constraints** on parameter ranges from LRT axioms

## 6. Theoretical Limitations and Future Work

### 6.1 Current Derivation Limitations

**Acknowledged gaps**:
1. **Free parameters not derived**: w_EM and α are phenomenological (require calibration)
2. **Environmental coupling not modeled**: Derivations assume isolated systems
3. **Quantum geometry not included**: No Hilbert space metric structure
4. **Constraint weights assumed additive**: More complex coupling possible

**Implications**:
- Predictions establish functional forms and ranges, not exact values
- Experimental measurements will calibrate free parameters
- Future theory work: Derive w_EM and α from deeper LRT principles

- Question: What determines w_EM relative to w_Id and w_NC?
- Approach: Information-theoretic measures of constraint "cost"
- Goal: Eliminate free parameter in T2/T1 prediction

**Priority 2**: Derive coupling strength α
- Question: How strongly does logical status couple to Hamiltonian?
- Approach: Quantum geometry, Fisher information metric
- Goal: Eliminate free parameter in δω prediction

**Priority 3**: Include environmental decoherence
- Question: How do Markovian/non-Markovian baths affect predictions?
- Approach: Lindblad master equations with LRT modifications
- Goal: More realistic decoherence models

**Priority 4**: Higher-dimensional systems
- Question: Do predictions generalize to multi-qubit entangled states?
- Approach: Tensor product Hilbert spaces, constraint composition
