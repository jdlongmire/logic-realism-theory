## HIGHEST PRIORITY - Sprint 5 Critical Path

### Priority 1: Integrate Track 2 Results into Paper (CRITICAL)

**Task**: Revise paper Section 5.1.2 with first-principles η derivation

**Why Critical**:
- Sprint 4 failed (0.728/0.80) specifically due to phenomenological η
- ALL THREE multi-LLM models identified this as critical issue
- Track 2 Approach 3 derivation directly addresses this
- Expected improvement: Section 5.1.2 score 0.83 → 0.90-0.95
- Expected impact: Overall score 0.728 → 0.75-0.80 (near/at threshold)

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 5.1.2)

**Content to Add**:
1. Replace phenomenological η approach with Fisher information derivation
2. Document: η = (J_superposition / J_ground) × (ΔS_EM / ln 2)
3. Present derived values: η = 0.0098 (entropy-weighted) or 0.9902 (Fisher-only)
4. Acknowledge mismatch with target [0.11, 0.43]
5. Frame as testable prediction: η ∈ [0.11, 0.43] requires J_ratio ∈ [0.20, 0.70]
6. Reference: `scripts/eta_information_derivation.py`

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverables**:
- Revised Section 5.1.2 (~1,500-2,000 words)
- Cross-references to Track 2 derivation
- Updated paper commit

---

### Priority 2: Multi-LLM Review of Revised Section 5.1.2

**Task**: Submit revised Section 5.1.2 for multi-LLM review

**Why Critical**:
- Validate that first-principles η addresses phenomenology critique
- Confirm quality score improvement to ≥ 0.90 for this section
- Determine if overall paper quality reaches ≥ 0.80 threshold

**Process**:
1. Extract revised Section 5.1.2 text
2. Prepare focused review query for multi-LLM team
3. Run consultation via `enhanced_llm_bridge.py`
4. Target: Section quality ≥ 0.90, team consensus "Accept"

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour (mostly waiting for LLM responses)

**Success Criteria**:
- Section 5.1.2 score ≥ 0.90
- η derivation rigor confirmed by all 3 models
- No critical issues identified

---

## HIGH PRIORITY - Sprint 5 Completion

### Priority 3: Track 3 - Pre-Mathematical Formulation

**Task**: Revise paper Section 2.3.1 (Ontological/Epistemic Distinction)

**Why Important**:
- Current score: 0.81 (barely acceptable)
- Weakest section philosophically
- Multi-LLM critiques: weak gravity analogy, L undefined, missing philosophical grounding

**Proposed Revisions**:
1. **Replace gravity analogy** with wave-particle duality (domain-specific, familiar to physicists)
2. **Define L's properties** explicitly:
   - Filtering: L selects consistent configurations
   - Universal: Applies to all information
   - Pre-formal: Independent of mathematical representation
   - Structural: Imposes geometric constraints
3. **Add ontic structural realism framework** (Ladyman & Ross citations)
4. **Link to predictions**: L → V_K geometry → Fisher information → η → T2/T1

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 2.3.1)

**Expected Impact**:
- Section 2.3.1 score: 0.81 → 0.87-0.90
- Overall paper score improvement: +0.01 to +0.02

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Deliverables**:
- Revised Section 2.3.1 (~800-1,000 words added/revised)
- Philosophical citations added
- Updated paper commit

---

### Priority 4: Track 4 - Lean Formalization Honesty

**Task**: Correct Section 9.1 Claims (Lean Language Precision)

**Why Important**:
- Multi-LLM review gave this section high marks (0.86 average)
- But still needs minor corrections per peer review Issue #4
- Quick fixes, high impact on integrity

**Actions**:
1. Review current Section 9.1 text
2. Ensure claims about "0 axioms" are precise
3. Verify distinction between mathematical vs physical axiomatization is clear
4. Add example Lean code snippet if helpful (Grok suggested this)

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/Logic-realism-theory-foundational.md` (Section 9.1)

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

**Deliverables**:
- Minor corrections to Section 9.1
- Optional: Lean code example
- Updated paper commit

---

### Priority 5: Other Sprint 4 Minor Issues

**Tasks**: Address remaining Sprint 4 multi-LLM critiques

**Section 3.4.1 (Non-Unitary Evolution)** - Score: 0.81
- Issue: K physical meaning unclear
- Fix: Add subsection explaining K determination
- Fix: Describe K → K-ΔK transition mechanism
- Estimated time: 1 hour

**Section 5.1.1 (Confound Isolation)** - Score: 0.86
- Issue: Confidence levels (60%, 80%, 95%) not justified
- Fix: Add paragraph with statistical basis
- Estimated time: 30 minutes

**Total Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY - Sprint 5 Documentation

### Priority 6: Create Notebook 08 - η First Principles

**Task**: Document η derivation in comprehensive notebook (like Notebook 07 for energy)

**Why Valuable**:
- Three-layer alignment: Computational → Formal → Documentation
- Scholarly exposition for external validation
- Cross-references to script, theory analysis, paper sections

**Structure** (following Notebook 07 template):
- Part 1: Shannon Entropy for EM Constraint
- Part 2: Fisher Information Geometry
- Part 3: Entropy Production Rates
- Part 4: Derive η from Information Ratio
- Part 5: Validation and Interpretation

**Files to Create**:
- `notebooks/Logic_Realism/08_Eta_First_Principles.ipynb`

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverables**:
- Complete notebook (~30-40 cells)
- Professional tone throughout
- 3-line copyright format
- Cross-references to scripts/theory/paper

---

### Priority 7: Sprint 5 Final Multi-LLM Review

**Task**: Comprehensive review of all Sprint 5 deliverables

**When**: After Priorities 1-4 complete (paper revisions done)

**Scope**:
- Energy derivation (Track 1): Scripts + Lean + Notebook 07
- η derivation (Track 2): Scripts + Notebook 08 (if created)
- Pre-mathematical formulation (Track 3): Revised Section 2.3.1
- Lean honesty (Track 4): Revised Section 9.1

**Process**:
1. Prepare comprehensive review package
2. Submit to multi-LLM team via enhanced_llm_bridge.py
3. Target: Overall quality ≥ 0.80 for Sprint 5 deliverables
4. Team consensus: "Accept" or "Minor Revision"

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour (query prep) + 1 hour (response analysis)

**Success Criteria**:
- Quality score ≥ 0.80
- All deliverables deemed rigorous and complete
- Sprint 5 marked as successful

---

### Priority 8: Sprint 5 Completion Documentation

- Document handoff to next sprint (if applicable)

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

## LOWER PRIORITY - Path 3 Protocol Revision

**Status**: Path 3 protocol review FAILED (0.622/0.70)

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. T1 and T2 definitions need clarification
2. Statistical power analysis missing
3. Error mitigation strategies insufficient
4. Resource commitment (~120 hours) not justified
5. Preliminary simulations lacking

**Recommendation**: Defer to future sprint after Sprint 5 complete

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (substantial revision)

**Files to Modify**:
- `theory/predictions/T1_vs_T2_Protocol.md`
- `scripts/path3_t1_vs_t2/` (add simulations)
